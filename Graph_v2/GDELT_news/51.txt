Global markets are already seeing an increase in prices for component and electronics as a result of the ongoing chip production crisis, but there is another negative effect that semiconductor shortage could have on supply chains: a flood of fake, substandard chips.
As Nikkei Asia reports, Japanese electronics manufacturer Jenesis is one of those that have suffered the most as a result of the fake chip phenomena in recent months.

Unfortunately, when the chips arrived, they were faulty.
An expert who inspected the chips at Jenesis' request found the specifications of the chips sent from China differed completely from what Jenesis had ordered. Interestingly, the chip manufacturer's name on the packages seemed to be genuine.
