"Last Updated 7 days ago U.S., EU agree to work on chip supplies, tech rules, China trade By David Lawder and Nandita Bose A security guard walks near EU and U.S. flags, before the EU-US summit, in Brussels, Belgium June 15, 2021. REUTERS/Yves Herman PITTSBURGH/WASHINGTON, Sept 29 (Reuters) - The United States and European Union agreed on Wednesday to deepen transatlantic cooperation to strengthen semiconductor supply chains, curb China's non-market trade practices and take a more unified approach to regulating big, global technology firms. Launching a new forum, the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC), senior cabinet officials from both continents also pledged to cooperate on the screening of investments on export controls for sensitive dual-use technologies and on the development of artificial intelligence (AI). The statement did not mention China but said: ""We stand together in continuing to protect our businesses, consumers, and workers from unfair trade practices, in particular those posed by non-market economies, that are undermining the world trading system."" The Biden administration has kept in place tariffs imposed by former U.S. president Donald Trump but has sought to differentiate itself by collaborating more with allies in its approach to China. The meetings were led by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai, EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis, and European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager. They met in a robotics and AI technology development center built inside the rusted skeleton of a former steel rolling mill topped with solar panels, a symbol of Pittsburgh's post-industrial rebirth as a tech hub. The meeting was nearly derailed by French anger over a U.S. decision this month to supply Australia with nuclear submarines, which prompted Canberra to scrap a $40 billion submarine contract with France. But the U.S. and EU governments backed a joint declaration to strengthen semiconductor supply chains, focusing initially on easing short-term supply bottlenecks and later on identifying longer-term vulnerabilities and ""strengthening our domestic semiconductor ecosystems, from research, design to manufacturing, with a view to improving resilience."" read more They said they would work to avoid a subsidy race to attract chip investments and seek ""the right incentives."" The statement did not specify a time frame for a second TTC meeting, but EU officials said this would likely take place in the spring of 2022 in Europe. Reuters was first to report a draft statement revealing a more unified approach to limit the growing market power of Big Tech. This was echoed in the final statement that identified common areas of concern such as illegal and harmful content amplified by algorithms. ""We are committed to transatlantic cooperation regarding platform policies that focus on disinformation, product safety, counterfeit products, and other harmful content,"" the statement said. With the United States and Europe trying to restrain the growing power of American tech giants such as Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google, Facebook (FB.O), Apple (AAPL.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O), such cooperation would make it harder for the U.S. tech industry to fight new rules. Vestager, who has taken a tough stance on the U.S. tech industry for years, said the discussions on AI were among the meeting's biggest takeaway. ""Minds are meeting for artificial intelligence to be trustworthy, to be human centered, and to have a risk based approach,"" Vestager told reporters after the meeting. The new tech and trade council has formed 10 working groups to deepen cooperation on these areas and others that include climate and clean technologies, communications technology security, and misuse of technology to repress human rights. Several tech trade groups in Washington said the industry does not want the United States to adopt the European approach to digital regulation. EU officials said the meeting's participants did not discuss one of the biggest transatlantic trade irritants - U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum that have prompted retaliatory EU duties on U.S. bourbon whiskey and motorcycles. On Tuesday, Dombrovskis said time was running short for the sides to reach agreement before an end-November deadline, but added the EU was ready to look at similar arrangements agreed by Canada and Mexico that lifted U.S. tariffs on their steel and aluminum exports to the United States in 2019.

Live Now: President Biden Hosts a Meeting with Business Leaders and CEOs on Addressing the Debt Limit #wh-oval-615df5677f3fe .st0{fill:#0A2458;} #wh-oval-615df5677f3fe .st1{fill-rule:evenodd;clip-rule:evenodd;fill:#FFFFFF;} #wh-oval-615df5677f3fe .st2{opacity:0.5;fill:#FFFFFF;} #wh-oval-615df5677f3fe .st3{fill:#FFFFFF;} TO SEARCH THIS SITE, ENTER A SEARCH TERM When the Chips Are Down: Preventing and Addressing Supply Chain Disruptions By: Sameera Fazili and Peter Harrell Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the things consumers and producers wanted, from cars to toilet paper to yeast to lumber, simply appeared in showrooms, on store shelves, and in ports to be purchased and used when convenient. But over the last 18 months, we’ve seen shortages in goods large and small, often due to surprisingly small causes and hidden vulnerabilities.  For example, the demand for yeast quadrupled in spring 2020, as homebound Americans tried their hand at making bread. Fleischmann’s Yeast, a major producer, had capacity to make yeast; it was lack of packaging that led to shortages and delays. The glass jars used to package the yeast were sourced from India, where production had been shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[1] Nimble firms resolved some of these shortages quickly. Fleischmann’s figured out how to package yeast in plastic bags, and toilet paper manufacturers made numerous small adjustments to equipment and product mix.[2] Others, like the semiconductor chip shortage, have proven harder to resolve and are dragging down the US economy. Some analysts estimate the chip shortage could cut nearly a percentage point from GDP growth this year, and it has resulted in waves of production shutdowns that have hurt the hundreds of thousands of U.S. workers employed in manufacturing jobs across the automotive and heavy trucking sectors.[3] The ability to recover quickly from an unexpected shock is a hallmark of a resilient system. When it comes to manufacturing supply chains, firms often adopt three inter-related strategies to strengthen resiliency: Visibility: The capability to monitor the supply chain, often in real time. Buffer: Having multiple sources of supply or holding more inventory. Agility: The ability to pivot quickly to alternative processes or products. However, an individual firm’s ability to pivot quickly in the face of a shock can be limited by collective action problems—including a lack of communication and trust between firms along a supply chain—and a lack of access to the data necessary to support visibility and agility. Government has a unique ability to solve coordination challenges and serve as a trusted source of data. This role is especially critical at times of shortage, to counter the tendency of downstream firms, like manufacturers of finished goods, to overorder or hoard inventory and of upstream firms, like manufacturers of the inputs, to not fulfill orders due to a lack of trust in the demand signal, which results in shortages, delays, price increases, and uncertainty for the workers, families, and small businesses who ultimately depend on these goods. Renewing our Commitment to Transparency and Agility Since April, the Administration has used its convening power to strengthen communication and trust between the firms that produce semiconductors—including those that design chips, produce wafers, and assemble them into devices—and those that use semiconductors—including automakers, consumer electronics firms, and medical device firms. The result has been a change in supply chain management practices by firms like General Motors, which announced new efforts to build more direct working relationships with semiconductor suppliers who are downstream suppliers to GM. It also includes a growing recognition by chip producers that industrial sectors like the automotive industry represent a growing customer base. This is progress, and we continue to look to industry to take further steps to improve transparency, trust, and communication to address supply chain bottlenecks. Today, the Department of Commerce is taking new steps to improve data collection, by conducting a voluntary survey of industry participants to both diagnose chokepoints in the supply chain and offer firms data that can help them adapt their production processes to adjust to the supply shortage. For example, the survey may show that the chips used in sensors that help activate a pacemaker and power the safety features of a car are in shortage, but not the ones that support power management on a device. In this way, the information can also provide a clear demand signal that can attract more private investment to expand capacity to resolve the shortage. In addition, to address shocks to global supply chains stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been working with foreign governments in Southeast Asia and elsewhere to keep critical factories up and running, while putting worker health and safety and the public health response of our trading partners at the center of our efforts. The Biden-Harris Administration is building on this work by standing up a new early alert system for COVID-related shutdowns to microelectronics manufacturing around the world. The system will allow us to detect potential disruptions earlier, and support faster problem solving and coordination with our trading partners and the private sector, balancing a focus on worker health and safety, supporting the public health response, and safely re-opening plants. This system is also designed to protect proprietary or business sensitive information for companies that voluntarily participate. The Commerce Department will be industry’s entry point, and they will work closely with the State Department—both here in Washington and also at our Embassies abroad. We will also rely on technical experts from USAID and the CDC to carry out this mission. Preventing the Next Chips Shortage In the longer term, however, the U.S. must take stronger action to identify and get ahead of vulnerabilities in the supply chains of critical goods. Supply chain shocks are not unexpected. A McKinsey Global Institute analysis found that supply-chain shocks affecting global production lasting at least a month occur on average every 3.7 years, leading companies to lose 42 percent of one year’s earnings every ten years. The climate crisis is causing supply chain-disrupting “100-year” events more frequently and with greater ferocity, due to increased intensity and frequency of storms, droughts, and other extreme weather events. U.S workers, consumers, and businesses will continue to suffer from disruptions and price shocks unless we take action, across the public and private sector and with partners and allies, to build more resilient supply chains. That is why the President has taken swift and persistent action to address supply chain vulnerabilities since he came into office. In February, he ordered a 100-day review of supply chains for select critical products and a 1-year review of vulnerabilities in the supply chains for select critical sectors. The 100-day report, published in June, lays out a framework for closing supply chain vulnerabilities by investing in U.S. workers, communities, and innovation. It also makes the case for a new federal toolbox for closing these vulnerabilities. This includes the capacity to map and monitor current gaps and conduct stress tests to identify future vulnerabilities, funding to support applied research on best practices on supply chain resiliency at both the firm-level and national-level, and financial tools including grants and loans to pull forward private sector investments in resiliency, countering the private market’s tendency to overinvest in short-term cost control and underinvest in resiliency. There are two critical steps that Congress could take to accelerate our progress towards more resilient supply chains. First, Congress could fund the bipartisan CHIPS for America Act, which would enable transformative investments in domestic semiconductor research, design, and manufacturing. This is the long-term solution to solving the current chip shortage. Second, Congress could establish the new Critical Supply Chain Resiliency Program (CSCRP) at the Department of Commerce, which President Biden has proposed as part of his Build Back Better plan that is before Congress right now. The program would serve as a central node in the federal government for supply chain resilience, facilitate better coordination and planning across federal agencies to address vulnerabilities, and invest in critical supply chains where the private market has failed to allocate sufficient capital. Some examples of the activities the new office could support include: Mapping supply chains for critical industries: The U.S. government is trying to prevent disruptions in the supply chains for advanced energy and communications equipment. The CSCRP conducts a survey of firms in each industry, working with industry partners. The data and mapping from the survey allows the office to run stress tests for various shocks, including a cyber attack at a critical node, and run scenario planning exercises to facilitate greater preparedness across the private sector and government agencies to respond to potential shocks to a critical supply chain. Growing domestic clean energy supply chains: A U.S. consortium of green energy companies wishes to onshore the supply chain for manufacturing solar panels, 80% of which are currently made by Chinese companies due in part to Chinese government subsidies. The CSCRP provides low-cost financing to support the development of new U.S. factories so that a larger share of the planned U.S. renewables build-out is U.S.-made. Expanding supply of trusted and secure hardware: A promising early-stage 5G equipment start-up seeks to scale up manufacturing for 5G network infrastructure equipment. However, it has had trouble securing the late-stage funding to commercialize its technology, which has been a longstanding problem that has pushed many U.S. manufacturers offshore. The company is being courted by a contract manufacturer to move its production to Asia. To address this issue, CSCRP provides a direct loan, for one portion of its scale up need, and a loan guarantee for the rest. The federal government must be better equipped to get ahead of possible disruptions and have tools at its disposal to limit their impact on the U.S. economy, workers, and consumers. When supply chain shocks cascade, the spillover effects can impact the global economy in ways that no one firm or sector can anticipate or adequately resolve on their own. By taking a holistic view of the industrial base and supply chains critical to US economic and national security, the federal government can monitor, anticipate, and respond to economic, geopolitical, and climate-related shocks. The CHIPS Act and the CSCRP are two important steps towards our goal of strengthening our nation’s longer term economic competitiveness, our national security, and advancing the President’s 21st century industrial strategy. The key to resolving the next global supply chain crisis is preventing it from happening in the first place.

Skip to main content The Struggle to Define Long COVID What Booster Shots Can and Can’t Do My Family Was a COVID Cluster CommentOctober 4, 2021 Issue Why, more than a year and a half into the pandemic, do strange shortages keep popping up in so many corners of American life? By Amy Davidson Sorkin A good way to get people talking, in this lingering pandemic era, is to ask whether they have tried to rent a car lately. Even if they haven’t, they have likely heard stories, perhaps about largely empty lots at the Atlanta airport, where customers were forced to compete in what the actress Audra McDonald, in an angry tweet, called a “hunger games relay,” or about the man who told the Los Angeles Times that he had booked a compact car to take his kids to Disneyland only to be directed to a van that “reeked of cigarettes and marijuana.” But most of the stories are more quotidian; the common elements are long lines, high rates, few choices, and mysterious references to “supply-chain issues.” Illustration by João Fazenda What are these supply-chain issues, and why, more than a year and a half into the pandemic, do they keep popping up in so many corners of life? The shortage of rental cars—as well as used and new cars—isn’t expected to let up until at least next year. Last week, the Park Slope Food Co-op, in Brooklyn, sent an e-mail to members explaining that certain types of pasta could be out of stock; other purveyors are having trouble getting chicken wings. At times, it’s been oddly hard to come by plumbing fixtures, construction materials, salad dressing, and even some new books. Remote work and schooling have added to the demand for tech products, contributing to long waits. Most items are, ultimately, available, if at a higher price; during the past year, the Consumer Price Index has risen about five per cent, double the percentage it rose in the year before the pandemic. Americans are not facing Soviet-style empty shelves, or having to scrap for the basics. In aggregate, we are hardly in a condition of scarcity. Still, supply-chain trouble suggests that something is off with the way we’re operating in the world, and that we don’t yet know the extent of our vulnerabilities. The issues can also be a serious impediment to a broader economic recovery. The most obvious culprit is covid-19. In the case of rental cars, when travel decreased sharply in the spring of 2020, many companies generated cash by selling off a sizable portion of their fleets. They may have assumed that they could just buy more cars later, but when the time came cars weren’t available. The main reason for that is a worldwide shortage of semiconductors, the chips used in automotive systems—the supply has been constrained by covid-related plant closures in Asia, where many of them are made. Last week, the Wall Street Journal estimated that, because of the “chip famine,” some seven million cars were not built. Last Thursday, Gina Raimondo, the Secretary of Commerce, hosted an industry summit on the chip shortage, with executives from companies including Ford and General Motors, as well as Apple and Samsung, which are also competing for semiconductors. Afterward, her office said that one of its goals is to build supply-chain “trust.” (Another is to explore how the United States can become less dependent on overseas suppliers.) A White House briefing posted the same day said that the dearth of chips was “dragging down the US economy,” and cited an estimate that it may lop a percentage point off G.D.P. growth. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER The Profound Loneliness of Being Deported What’s often at the heart of a supply-chain issue is a labor issue. Last week, the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach were approaching a crisis state because more than seventy container ships were idling offshore, in what had become a maritime parking lot; there aren’t enough dockworkers to unload their cargo, or enough truck drivers to move it out of the ports. (Shipping rates have spiked, too.) Labor shortages are the reason that so many things just seem to be in the wrong place—the prime symptom of a supply-chain squeeze. “Just in time” delivery works only if you can deliver. The labor situation, too, is no doubt related to covid-19, but there is wide disagreement about exactly how. A significant number of people who were laid off early in the pandemic because of closures haven’t gone back to work, even as more businesses reopen. The factors cited include a fear of infection and an aversion to dealing with customers who are angry about policies, or the lack of them, requiring masks and proof of vaccination—a particular concern for restaurant workers, who are also in short supply. Some essential workers, such as health aides and delivery drivers, who were hit hard by the pandemic, may be reassessing their jobs; and many of the more than six hundred thousand people who have died of covid were members of the workforce. Professional reckonings have taken place among higher-paid workers, too. Transitions require mobility and time. And, even with schools reopening, a shortage of affordable day care (and of day-care workers) means that some parents who want to return to jobs can’t do so. Many of these circumstances, notably the lack of child care, were not so much caused by the pandemic as exposed by it. (The same could be said of another shortage: affordable housing.) The question of how to solve the labor issue can’t be answered without an examination of values and priorities. Would it be better to persuade people to fill jobs by further cutting unemployment benefits, or by raising the federal minimum wage, which is still $7.25 an hour, or raising wages generally? What about adding support for child care, paid family leave, and public transportation—measures being debated in Congress now—or increasing immigration? Referring to supply-chain issues, in other words, can be a useful shorthand when a problem arises, but it’s an insufficient one. For that matter, pinning the supply-chain meltdown on the pandemic can be an evasion. Last week, at the Council on Foreign Relations, the Irish Taoiseach, or Prime Minister, Micheál Martin, said that multiple supply-chain breakdowns created by Brexit had been “masked by covid.” (The United Kingdom has faced shortages of everything from fuel to the carbon dioxide needed for processing many foods.) Similarly, recent storms have caused major disruptions; by one estimate, Hurricane Ida alone wrecked a quarter of a million cars. Such severe weather events are a reminder that the pandemic supply-chain ruptures may pale compared with those which will be associated with the climate crisis in coming years. Indeed, one of the most urgent tasks now may be to think about the two issues together. In both cases, the scramble for quick fixes—clearing downed power lines, restocking pasta—can distract from the need for systemic change. The real challenge, when it comes to thinking about supply chains, isn’t making sure that a container ship is unloaded. It’s deciding how we want to live. ♦ Published in the print edition of the October 4, 2021, issue, with the headline “Stock Answers.” Amy Davidson Sorkin has been a staff writer at The New Yorker since 2014.

"Search quotes, news & videos AMD CEO Lisa Su says chip shortage likely to end next year Share Article via Facebook Share Article via Twitter Share Article via LinkedIn Share Article via Email The global chip shortage will become less severe in the second half of 2022, AMD CEO Lisa Su said on Monday. ""We've always gone through cycles of ups and downs, where demand has exceeded supply, or vice versa,"" Su said at the Code Conference in Beverly Hills, California. ""This time, it's different."" Manufacturing plants that were planned last year will likely start producing chips in the coming months, helping to alleviate shortages for PC parts and other microchips, Su said. Lisa Su, CEO, AMD Scott Mlyn | CNBC The global chip shortage will become less severe in the second half of 2022, AMD CEO Lisa Su said on Monday, though she warned that the first half of the year will be ""likely tight."" Chipmakers are still catching up to demand following severe supply chain bottlenecks created by the pandemic. But manufacturing plants that were planned last year will likely start producing chips in the coming months, helping to alleviate shortages for PC parts and other microchips, Su said. ""We've always gone through cycles of ups and downs, where demand has exceeded supply, or vice versa,"" Su said at the Code Conference in Beverly Hills, California. ""This time, it's different."" The improvements will be gradual as more manufacturing capacity becomes available, Su said. ""It might take, you know, 18 to 24 months to put on a new plant, and in some cases even longer than that,"" she said. ""These investments were started perhaps a year ago."" AMD primarily sells processors and graphics chips for PCs, gaming consoles, and servers. Since the Covid-19 pandemic started in 2020, PC sales have jumped as consumers across the globe bought new computers for their homes and so their kids could attend school remotely. ""The pandemic has just taken demand to a new level,"" Su said. But the demand for chips and PC parts has stayed high even as economies reopened, and shortages spread to other industries, including cars. That's helped boost AMD's stock more than 120% since the beginning of last year, to just over $108. Su said that AMD supports the CHIPS Act, which became law earlier this year and includes subsidies to encourage microchip manufacturing in the U.S. AMD doesn't manufacturer its own chips, and instead outsources production to foundries, or chip factories. AMD rival Intel said this year that it would continue to invest in microchip manufacturing and would be a foundry to other chip companies. Last year, AMD announced it planned to buy Xilinx in a deal worth $35 billion, but the company has not yet received all the approvals it needs to complete the acquisition. Su said that AMD still sees the deal closing by the end of the year. She added that there will likely be more dealmaking in the semiconductor industry. ""Consolidation is inevitable,"" Su said. ""Start-ups can do really cool things. I have tremendous respect for these these folks who start their own companies. But if you want to do something very large for the industry, you know, scale is important."" WATCH: What's the best way to solve the chip shortage crisis?

Search quotes, news & videos Abu Dhabi-controlled GlobalFoundries files for U.S. IPO amid worldwide chip shortage PUBLISHED MON, OCT 4 20211:50 PM EDTUPDATED MON, OCT 4 20217:34 PM EDT Share Article via Facebook Share Article via Twitter Share Article via LinkedIn Share Article via Email GlobalFoundries was established in 2008, when a branch of the government of Abu Dhabi bought AMD’s manufacturing operations in Dresden, Germany. The semiconductor industry will require a significant increase in investment to keep up with demand, with total industry revenue expected to double over the next eight to ten years,” GlobalFoundries said in its prospectus. GlobalFoundries campus in Malta, N.Y. Mary Thompson | CNBC GlobalFoundries, the world’s third-largest semiconductor foundry, is headed for a U.S. IPO, as the Abu-Dhabi-owned company bolsters investments in its U.S. manufacturing sites. GlobalFoundries said Monday in its Securities and Exchange Commission prospectus that Mubadala, a United Arab Emirates state investment fund, will list its shares on the Nasdaq and “continue to have substantial control after this offering.” Mubadala currently owns 100% of the company. The company is third in the market for semiconductor fabrication, behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) and Samsung. The company has three U.S. plants — two in New York State and one in Burlington, Vermont — as well as a plant in Germany and another in Singapore. One of the New York sites, located in East Fishkill, was purchased by ON Semiconductor in 2019 and will be transferred off GlobalFoundries’ books next year. In April, GlobalFoundries moved its headquarters from Santa Clara, California, to Malta, New York, home to its most advanced facility. CEO Tom Caulfield, a native New Yorker, told CNBC that month that the company plans to invest $1.4 billion in chip factories in 2021 and will likely double its investment next year. Formed in 2008, when a division of Mubadala purchased AMD’s manufacturing operations in Dresden, Germany, GlobalFoundries counts chipmakers Qualcomm, Broadcom, Samsung and AMD among its largest customers. As a group, its top 10 customers account for close to three-quarters of revenue. GlobalFoundries manufactures chips designed by its customers for use in contactless payments, battery power management touch display drivers and many other purposes. Intel announced in March it plans to compete in the market and become a foundry for other companies, expecting to invest $20 billion in U.S. plants. With the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, demand surged for electronics like laptops, monitors and game consoles. This led to a supply shortage and underscoring the need for more capacity. Consumers are also flocking to electric vehicles, further stressing the supply chain. “Although the supply-demand imbalance is expected to improve over the medium-term, the semiconductor industry will require a significant increase in investment to keep up with demand, with total industry revenue expected to double over the next eight to ten years,” GlobalFoundries said in its prospectus. Revenue at GlobalFoundries dropped last year by 17% to $4.85 billion, but the company highlighted two main reasons for the decline. GlobalFoundries divested a business that brought in $391 million in 2019, and more broadly the company shifted contractual terms with most of its customers, changing how and when it recognizes revenue. In the first half of 2021, revenue climbed by 13% from a year earlier to just over $3 billion. Operating foundries is an inherently low-margin business, with high costs associated with labor, running plants and buying equipment and raw materials. For the first half of this year, GlobalFoundries recorded a gross margin, or the revenue left after accounting for the cost of goods sold, of close to 11%, a reversal from a negative margin a year earlier. Its net loss for the six-month period narrowed to $301 million from $534 million. While GlobalFoundries has its corporate headquarters in the U.S., it’s considered a “foreign issuer” because it was incorporated in the Cayman Islands by Mubadala. That means the company is exempt from certain Nasdaq rules that apply to U.S. companies, like having most of its board seats occupied by independent directors and seeking shareholder approval for some equity compensation agreements. GlobalFoundries hasn’t said how much money it plans to raise or how much Mubadala will control after the offering. Whatever the ownership level, investors will have to stomach the risk of buying into a company controlled by Abu Dhabi. “Mubadala will continue to have substantial control after this offering, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control, and otherwise affect the prevailing market price of our ordinary shares,” GlobalFoundries said in the risk factors of the prospectus.

""And a couple of years ago this vehicle was a lot cheaper than what it is today and an average consumer would think, 'Hey why is the price raising on the vehicle?' The answer to that? Less inventory. ""We’ve had clients come all the way from Ohio to purchase a vehicle and drive it all the way back,"" said Bolling. ""And we specifically asked him, 'hey what brings you all the way to Virginia?' He says the lack of good quality vehicles."" Bolling said his lot at the Auto Kingdom of Virginia is about half full. ""It's really affecting us right now in 2021,"" Bolling said. He said shortages in quality cars led to higher prices for dealerships and in turn, for customers as well. ""The major car dealers are buying all the used cars, so it makes the inventory less accessible,"" Bolling said. ""It’s a domino effect down to the smaller dealerships."" But he added that his business was still committed to giving customers a great deal and vehicle. ""We keep them as low as possible which is reasonable for both ends, the dealership and the consumer. So, we try to meet in the middle,"" Bolling said. As for the shortages, Smith said General Motors didn't stockpile computer chips when they had the opportunity, and now chips are in low supply. ""So many cars now rely on microchips for so many things. If you don't have those, you can't produce new cars,"" Smith said. He added that shortages expanded beyond vehicles. ""I think we're going to be short on everything, largely,"" Smith said. He predicted we may start to rebound come 2022 but said it would be a slow recovery that may last into the coming years.

Conway/Shell International Limited Natural gas has long been oil’s poor step-cousin, a commodity that many ignore until they have to pay their heating bill. Now, natural gas is the lead player in a drama that is gradually dragging down the world economy. A surge in the price of the commodity—along with other fuel sources, like coal and propane—is forcing countries to reduce factory production, and could drive heating and electricity prices sky-high this winter.

"Biden Puts Semiconductor Supply Chains Under Microscope Kay Georgi, John Gurtunca, David Hanke, Marwa Hassoun In late September, the Biden Administration took a variety of actions to address the ongoing global semiconductor shortage and the various supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.   That includes convening a White House meeting with key players in the semiconductor industry, issuing a RFI to industry on the chip supply chain, and again calling on Congress to help bolster domestic semiconductor supply chains and domestic industrial capacity. Commerce Department issues a request for information (RFI) from industry on the shortage of semiconductors and the semiconductor supply chain. White House pushes Congress to fund the implementation of the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) for America Act to resolve and prevent future semiconductor shortages. Commerce Continues Engagement with the Semiconductor Industry On September 23, 2021, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese convened a White House meeting with major semiconductor manufacturers and customers, where they “discussed the progress industry has made to address supply chain challenges and increase supply chain transparency.” The meeting, which was the third such gathering convened by the Biden Administration, was held in concert with an assertive move by the U.S. Department of Commerce to gather information on the semiconductor industry. Specifically, on September 24, 2021, the Commerce Department, Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) — the agency primarily responsible for regulating dual-use and some military exports — released an RFI calling for U.S. and non-U.S. entities throughout the semiconductor supply chain to share information about their production practices, capacity, inventories, and market demand as BIS seeks to formulate strategies for combating the global chip shortage. The RFI seeks information “[w]ith the goal of facilitating the flow of information across the various segments of the supply chain, identifying data gaps and bottlenecks in the supply chain, and potential inconsistent demand signals.” The RFI also contains two sets of questions: The first set of questions is directed at “semiconductor product design, front and back-end manufacturers and microelectronics assemblers, and their suppliers and distributors.” These questions seek information on, among other things: Sales and inventories from years 2019 and 2020, as well as an estimate for 2021; Which semiconductor products have the largest order backlogs and sales of those products; and Data on product fabrication and package/assembly locations, as well as the top three customers for those products.   The second set of questions targets semiconductor end users, from whom BIS requests information on: The semiconductor products they are having difficulty acquiring, Their 2019 and 2020 purchases of those products, as well as average monthly orders for 2021, and The quantity of those products they would purchase over the next six months “barring any production constraints.” BIS is also requesting information in both sets of questions on the primary bottlenecks faced by the relevant entities, and “[w]hat single change (and to which portion of the supply chain) would most significantly increase” entities’ ability to supply or purchase semiconductors in the next six months. Comments are due on November 8, 2021, and can be submitted via the Federal eRulemaking Portal, referencing docket number BIS 2021-0036 or RIN 0694-XC084. Secretary Raimondo’s public comments indicate that Commerce expects industry to cooperate with the RFI and provide useful supply chain data and that she is frustrated with the perceived lack of cooperation from industry thus far. In a September 23, 2021 interview with Bloomberg, she said the Biden Administration is considering invoking the Defense Production Act to compel companies in the semiconductor supply chain to provide the information she seeks.   White House Policymakers Call on Congress to Bolster Supply Chains Sameera Fazili, the Deputy Director of the National Economic Council, and Peter Harrell, who serves as Senior Director for International Economics and Competitiveness at the National Security Council, also joined the overall effort, writing in a White House blog post published on September 23, 2021, that the information provided in response to the RFI could “provide a clear demand signal that can attract more private investment to expand capacity to resolve the shortage.” The blog post also covers the steps the Biden Administration has taken and will take to address supply chain shocks caused by COVID-19 and the global chip shortage. It also calls on Congress to help alleviate the shortage. Fazili and Harrell wrote that the Administration has “been working with foreign governments in Southeast Asia and elsewhere to keep critical factories up and running,” and will set up a “new early alert system for COVID-related shutdowns to microelectronics manufacturing around the world” that “will allow us to detect potential disruptions earlier” and support faster solutions in coordination with trading partners and the private sector. Regarding Congress, Fazili and Harrell wrote that there are two steps lawmakers can take to “accelerate our progress towards more resilient supply chains.” First, they ask that Congress “fund the bipartisan CHIPS for America Act, which would enable transformative investments in domestic semiconductor research, design, and manufacturing.” Second, they said Congress should “establish the new Critical Supply Chain Resiliency Program (CSCRP) at the Department of Commerce” as called for in President Biden’s Build Back Better plan. The program would “serve as a central node in the federal government for supply chain resilience, facilitate better coordination and planning across federal agencies to address vulnerabilities, and invest in critical supply chains where the private market has failed to allocate sufficient capital.” The CSCRP has not yet been authorized or funded by Congress. However, after a complex multi-committee process, on June 8, 2021, the Senate advanced the United States Innovation and Competition Act (USICA), which would, among other things, create a “Supply Chain Resilience Program” with broad authority. In fact, under the Senate-passed bill, this new program would also incorporate the CHIPS for America Act’s centerpiece effort to incentivize domestic manufacturing of semiconductors. While USICA has apparently stalled on the House side, it may come back to life later this year or early next year.   Meanwhile, the House’s massive budget reconciliation package, which would implement President Biden’s “Build Back Better” agenda, contains a provision written by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce that would provide relevant funding. The bill, which is now under consideration, would appropriate $10 billion over five years for a seemingly related program to allow the Commerce Department to provide grants to domestic enterprises, manufacturers, regional and technology hubs, and other entities in order to shore up U.S. supply chains.

Search quotes, news & videos Elon Musk says the chip shortage is a ‘short-term’ problem PUBLISHED FRI, SEP 24 20217:41 AM EDTUPDATED SAT, SEP 25 20212:50 AM EDT Share Article via Facebook Share Article via Twitter Share Article via LinkedIn Share Article via Email The tech billionaire said he thinks chip shortage is a “short-term” problem as opposed to a long-term one.  “There’s a lot of chip fabrication plants that are being built and I think we will have good capacity by next year,” Musk said at an Italian tech event that was streamed online Friday. Chip heavyweights Intel and TSMC have announced plans to build new plants in the U.S. but they won’t come online for several years yet. Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk speaks to the media next to its Model S. Nora Tam | South China Morning Post | Getty Images Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Friday that the ongoing semiconductor crisis will be over by next year. The tech billionaire said he thinks chip shortage is a “short-term” problem as opposed to a long-term one.  “There’s a lot of chip fabrication plants that are being built and I think we will have good capacity by next year,” Musk said at an Italian tech event that was streamed online Friday. Musk did not specify which chip plants he was referring to. Chip heavyweights Intel and TSMC have announced plans to build new plants in the U.S. but they won’t come online for several years yet. Glenn O’Donnell, a vice president research director at advisory firm Forrester, believes the shortage could last until 2023. “Because demand will remain high and supply will remain constrained, we expect this shortage to last through 2022 and into 2023,” he wrote in a blogpost in April. The global chip shortage has had a major impact on a wide range of industries, but the automotive sector has been particularly badly hit. Big names in the industry such as Ford, Volkswagen and Daimler have all been forced to suspend production at various points and cut their manufacturing targets as a result of a lack of chips. During the company’s first-quarter earnings, Musk said that Tesla had some supply chain issues, before going on to reference the chip shortage.  “This quarter, and I think we’ll continue to see that a little bit in Q2 and Q3, had some of the most difficult supply chain challenges that we’ve ever experienced in the life of Tesla and same difficulties with supply chain, with parts — over the whole range of parts. Obviously, people have heard about the chip shortage. This is a huge problem.” Consulting firm AlixPartners predicted this week that the chip shortage will cost the automotive industry $210 billion in revenue this year alone.  “Of course, everyone had hoped that the chip crisis would have abated more by now, but unfortunate events such as the COVID-19 lockdowns in Malaysia and continued problems elsewhere have exacerbated things,” said Mark Wakefield, global co-leader of the automotive and industrial practice at AlixPartners, in a statement. How the global computer chip shortage happened Carmakers use semiconductors in everything from power steering and brake sensors, to entertainment systems and parking cameras. The smarter cars get, the more chips they use. In 2019, Tesla started producing cars with custom AI chips that help on-board software make decisions in response to what’s happening on the road. Musk said in July that production of Tesla’s Powerwall product, a backup battery for the home, was “lagging” as a result of the chip shortage.

"Last Updated 15 days ago GM president: Global chip supplies to stabilize at lower-than-desired levels General Motors President Mark Reuss talks about the Chevrolet 2021 Suburban and Tahoe SUVs in Detroit, Michigan, U.S. December 10, 2019. REUTERS/Rebecca Cook DETROIT, Sept 21 (Reuters) - General Motors Co's (GM.N) president said on Tuesday the global supply of semiconductor chips will begin to stabilize but at lower levels than the auto industry wants as it tries to rebuild vehicle inventories. ""We're going to see a stablization to some extent before we see getting the volume we really need,"" Mark Reuss said at a conference hosted by the Detroit Regional Chamber on Mackinac Island in northern Michigan. The global chip shortage has caused GM and automakers globally to idle production at plants, with some executives warning the issue could linger into 2023. GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said last week GM expects a ""more stable year"" in 2022 for chip suppliers, but warned third-quarter wholesale deliveries could be down by 200,000 vehicles due to the shortage. read more Looking ahead, Reuss said a crucial issue for the auto industry would be recycling materials used in electric vehicle (EV) batteries, such as rare earth minerals. ""There's a lot of material in a battery cell that can be reused,"" he said. ""We're spending time on that."" GM in July said it was investing in a U.S. lithium project that could become the country's largest by 2024, making the No. 1 U.S. automaker one of the first to develop its own source of a battery metal needed for EVs. Reuss said GM was also looking at opportunities in Australia, without disclosing details. read more Reporting by Ben Klayman Editing by Chris Reese and Barbara Lewis Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

"Last Updated a day ago UK's Melrose hit by cancelled orders as carmakers battle chip crisis A researcher plants a semiconductor on an interface board during a research work to design and develop a semiconductor product at Tsinghua Unigroup research centre in Beijing, China, February 29, 2016. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo Oct 5 (Reuters) - British parts supplier Melrose (MRON.L) is seeing up to 25% of monthly orders from automotive clients cancelled, it said on Tuesday, as the industry remains engulfed in a chip shortage that has forced carmakers to cut production. Shares in FTSE 100 (.FTSE) listed Melrose were down 3.2% at 0905 GMT, lagging the broader market. Melrose, whose GKN unit supplies parts like driveline systems to Volkswagen and other major carmakers, said its businesses should still meet annual profit margin targets if car production this year catches up to last year's total. ""Tightened supply of semiconductors to the automotive industry are frustrating and difficult to plan for,"" Melrose Chief Executive Simon Peckham said in a statement. ""But whilst they affect current trading, they don't impact long-term value, particularly as cash is well controlled and debt reduced,"" he added. Melrose also said it was focused on saving costs against a backdrop of rising inflation and all its businesses would take ""whatever actions are necessary"". The company's profits plummeted last year as the pandemic wrought havoc on its aerospace division, which supplies components to aircraft including the Eurofighter Typhoon. While the aerospace unit has begun to recover, Melrose's automotive division has been hurt by the chip crisis, which began during the pandemic due to unprecedented demand for chips used in digital products while car use waned. The crisis has affected a range of industries globally and forced carmakers to cut production and temporarily shut down plants. ""While we expect fairly substantial cuts to near-term consensus estimates, we believe that the underlying progress at Melrose is strong,"" Stifel analyst Mark Davies Jones said in a note, referring to analyst forecasts. Melrose said ""in month cancellations"" from automotive customers had climbed to 20%-25% of orders from a normal 1% per month during January-March. Meanwhile, revenue from its aerospace division rose 16% in the September quarter, Melrose said.

Search quotes, news & videos The U.S. and EU discuss ways to solve the global chip shortage: Here’s what you need to know PUBLISHED THU, SEP 30 20219:06 AM EDT Share Article via Facebook Share Article via Twitter Share Article via LinkedIn Share Article via Email French irritation reportedly watered down the statement issued by both sides at the end of the meeting on Wednesday evening. In a joint statement, the group added that it is committed “to building a partnership on the rebalancing of global supply chains in semiconductors.” However, there has been no breakthrough yet on the tariff front. Katherine Tai, U.S. trade representative, from left, Gina Raimondo, U.S. commerce secretary, Antony Blinken, U.S. secretary of state, Valdis Dombrovskis, trade commissioner for the European Union (EU), and Margrethe Vestager, competition commissioner of the European Commission. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images LONDON — The United States and the European Union have agreed to a “rebalancing” of global supply chains when it comes to semiconductors, in what could be the first of many trade and tech focused meetings. The U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council, referred to as TTC, emerged in the wake of Joe Biden’s presidential victory as the European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, looked to overcome transatlantic disputes in these areas. The Trump administration had slapped tariffs on the EU and the bloc had been keen to find a solution with the new president. Pittsburgh hosted the group’s first gathering on Wednesday. Preparations for the meeting were held up following Australia’s decision to cancel a submarine deal with France, instead opting for a U.S. agreement which angered the French. French irritation reportedly watered down the statement issued by both sides at the end of the meeting on Wednesday evening. Cecilia Bonefeld-Dahl, director-general of DigitalEurope which represents tech companies and trade associations, told CNBC that she hopes the U.S. and the EU will keep geopolitical and industrial issues apart. “It’s also in the interest of the U.S. to have a strong digital Europe,” she said over the phone. For now, both sides agreed “to identify gaps in the semiconductor value chain and strengthening our domestic semiconductor ecosystems.” In a joint statement, the group added that it is committed “to building a partnership on the rebalancing of global supply chains in semiconductors.” This area has seen major disruption in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Demand for chips has outgrown supply in the past months, which has impacted the production of many products, including cars, TVs and many other electrical appliances. This is a concern for the EU given that it is currently heavily dependent on international supply chains. As such, the commission is working on new policies to boost chip production in the bloc and reduce its dependence on other parts of the world. In addition, although the final statement doesn’t mention China, some of the pledges certainly seemed to be targeted at Beijing. “We intend to work closely together to address non-market, trade-distortive policies and practices, improve the effectiveness of our respective domestic measures,” the U.S. and the EU said. Officials have on numerous occasions criticized Beijing for not giving the same level of access to foreign business as to what is granted to Chinese companies abroad. “Very happy with today’s exchange and joint statement with our transatlantic partners,” Europe’s competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, said on Twitter following the meeting. U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai also said she was “energized” by the meeting and looked forward “to strengthening our tech and trade partnership with the EU.” What about trade tariffs? However, there has been no breakthrough yet on the tariff front. The U.S. and the EU agreed earlier in the summer to find a compromise to ongoing steel and aluminum tariffs, imposed during the Trump presidency, by the end of November. Speaking earlier this week, the EU’s trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis told Bloomberg that “time is running out.” UP NEXT | Fast Money 5:00 PM ET UP NEXT | Fast Money 5:00 PM ET Subscribe to CNBC PRO Join the CNBC Panel Got a confidential news tip?

Silicon wafers chips are a small slice of semi-conductors, a vital tech component inside all complex electronics from cell phones to cruise missiles. They also require critical minerals and advanced processing techniques to produce, two areas where the United States is lagging behind China and other Asian competitors. Today, the gap between semiconductor chip order and delivery times range between 18 weeks and 6 months, whereas pre-pandemic wait times hovered around12 weeks. This has meant a massive bottleneck for auto manufacturers, who depend on semiconductors to power increasingly complex car computers. The global auto industry is expected to lose out on $110 billion in 2021 revenue due to semiconductor supply chain issues. General Motors GM -0.9% expects the chip shortage will cut its earnings by $1.5 billion to $2 billion this year while Ford Motor F -1.1% said supply issues could lower its earnings up to $2.5 billion in 2021.   But not Tesla TSLA +0.2%. In Q3 of 2020 Tesla orders surged by 45% to the highest in company history. Despite the pandemic, it fell just shy of its 500,000 unit sales goal for 20202. How is this possible? In an effort to reduce its reliance on Asian chip makers and improve energy efficiency, the EV innovative juggernaut set out on a mission (dating back to 2016) to produce its own in-house chips. And rather than being made entirely of silicon – the preferred choice for mass produced semi-conductors – Tesla pursued a new material technology known and Silicon Carbide (SiC). The company has used this new wafer makeup to great success in its latest models. The unique properties of silicon-carbide make it much more energy efficient and durable relative to traditional silicon wafers. Due to their improved thermal conductivity, SiCs reduce energy loss by as much as 50%. Tesla’s accelerated move away from standard silicon wafer usage during the pandemic is particularly impressive and their innovation has inspired other companies to follow suit. Here’s The List Of 317 Wind Energy Rejections The Sierra Club Doesn’t Want You To See Revisiting The Blame For High Gas Prices Why Do ‘Fracking’ Opponents Ignore Its Moral Benefits? The semiconductor order/delivery gap continues to grow BLOOMBERGNEF Semiconductors control flows of electricity in EVs, cell phones, fighter jets, heavy machinery, and are an essential component of any computer system. Their production requires heavy use of critical and rare earth minerals, such as lithium and gallium. In the wake of Covid and rising demand for electronics, the sourcing of such materials and their supply chains are now of primary importance to governments and the private sector alike. In 2018, the US Department of Interior identified 35 critical minerals crucial for national and economic security. The United States is 100% import reliant on 14 minerals on the critical minerals list (aside from a small amount of recycling). These minerals are difficult to substitute inputs into the U.S. economy and national security applications; they include graphite, manganese, niobium, rare earths, and tantalum, among others. The United States is more than 75% import reliant on an additional 10 critical minerals: antimony, barite, bauxite, bismuth, potash, rhenium, tellurium, tin, titanium concentrate, and uranium. Rare earths, which constitute 17 of 35 minerals on the list, are equally important to production. Despite their name, rare earths are commonly found in the Earth’s crust. However, extracting economically mineable concentrations is difficult, thus their low supply.   The U.S. is currently reliant on Chinese sourcing and refinement of critical minerals and rare earths. In 2018 the U.S. derived 98% of its processed rare earths from China. Beijing also produced 62% of global rare earth raw materials in 2018, whereas the U.S. extracted just 12.2%. Exposing a significant vulnerability, the acquisition of crucial supply materials from a geopolitical adversary may ultimately generate supply cut-offs in projected conflict. China owns a majority of critical mineral and rare earth supply reserves, holding 36.7% while U.S. totals only make up 1.1% of the global market. Seeking to not only expand their production capacity at home, Chinese producers have sought to negotiate long-term agreements in Africa, Australia, and South America. Should they acquire a higher portion of the critical mineral supply chain than already held, the U.S. will likely struggle to capture reliable sources of material in the long-term. Recognizing their importance to electric vehicle production, Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos have backed an artificial intelligence startup that will team up with the 2nd largest global mining group to search for metals used in car batteries. KoBold Metals and Broken Hill Propriety (BHP) will hunt for nickel, cobalt, lithium, and copper, in Australia. The partnership may help Tesla acquire nickel to be used in their vehicles, as BHP signed a deal with Tesla in July to supply the mineral for battery production. The venture signals a shift towards the prioritization of sourcing of critical minerals for use in environmentally friendly technology.  Certain efforts are being introduced – albeit slowly – to mitigate America’s reliance on China’s REE monopoly. In July 2020 the U.S. based Blue Line Corp. partnered with Australia’s Lynas corporation to begin building a heavy rare earth refinement facility in Texas. Later in 2021, funding was granted to Lynas to build a light rare earth refinement center for those metals used in consumer goods. The facilities will be the first domestic US facilities capable of importing rare earths for processing.   Bold renewable energy transition targets, such as those set by the Biden Administration, will require equally ambitious efforts to diversify mineral sourcing and expand the battery/semiconductor industry through increased competition with Asia. Tesla’s in-house production of semiconductors materials during COVID-19 is laudable, as the company has invented its way out of a short-term crisis, where potential supply chain bottlenecks of six months or more could have derailed production. Such private sector ingenuity should be encouraged by the U.S. Government as it looks to address Chinese dominance of critical mineral supply chains. In the face of Chinese competitive challenges, the U.S. and the allies should give rise to creative solutions like these to ensure tech pre-eminence. The DoD would do well to take a page out of Tesla’s playbook. With Assistance from Liam Taylor and James Grant Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. 	3

Silicon shortage: Why semiconductor chips are so hard to find with everything from cars to consoles delayed A perfect storm of Covid-19, heightening tensions with China and climate change is being blamed. But how long will the silicon shortage last? A smartphone factory in China, the global manufacturing hub – and the centre of the silicon crisis (Photo: Feature China/Barcroft Media/Getty) October 4, 2021 3:05 pm(Updated 3:06 pm) Christmas is already in peril – with shortages of foods, turkeys and toys all feared due to supply chain issues blighting the consumer landscape. Now the prospect of a silicon shortage can be thrown into the mix – affecting electronic goods such as smartphones and games consoles – and a whole host of other products and devices that rely on computer chips. A shortage of silicon chips, fuelled by the quadrupling of silicon metal prices in just two months, is sending shockwaves through the world of technology. The freshest exclusives and sharpest analysis, curated for your inbox Signs of a crisis go back months – with car manufacturers shutting down production lines in April due to a shortage of chips. At that time, typhoons in Taiwan were blamed for affecting production, and a huge drop in demand for cars thanks to Covid-19 had led the chip industry to divert resources to the burgeoning computing sector. But the situation now is more acute and widespread, with the prolonged economic shocks of the pandemic combining with a plethora of factors to drive up the price of silicon metal. Silicon is a crucial building block in our mobile phones and computers, as well as in glass, concrete and car parts. On Friday, Norwegian chemicals firm Elkem ASA said it had suspended the sales of some silicon-made products. The shortage is a result of a perfect storm of conditions across public health, geopolitics and climate change. Silicon metal’s core component, which is present in sand and clay, makes up a whopping 28 per cent of the earth’s crust. So it should be cheap and plentiful. But a slowdown in silicon production has coupled with increasing demand to reveal the unstable foundations of many products we take for granted. That demand is – of course – linked to Covid-19, as employers and those working from home ordered more hardware and gadgets online. Apple recorded a 54 per cent increase in revenue in the first three months of 2021, when compared with the same period last year. Rising tensions between China and the West have contributed to the semiconductor shortage (Photo: Getty) But Covid-19 has also seen a sharp drop in manufacturing, with industrial workers in many parts of the world unable to be in their workplaces. As restrictions have eased, fear of infection has still limited the number of employees able to be on site at any one time. Production of both silicon metal and semi-conductors has taken a big hit. The world also relies heavily on China – the first country to be hit by the Covid-19 pandemic – for silicon chips. In the past few years, China has massively cut its usage of coal in an effort to reduce carbon emissions. The country is now experiencing rising energy costs. But Beijing fears that passing costs onto consumers would lead to rising inflation, so it is instead rationing electricity for industrial customers, which has hit silicon production. It is impossible to understand the silicon crisis without considering the context of rising tensions between China and the West. After the Australian government called for an international probe into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, Beijing imposed an unofficial ban on importing coal from Australia. This had a knock-on effect on China’s energy supply – and, in turn, silicon production. In fuel, staff and energy shortages, Boris Johnson is finally facing a crisis he can’t bluster his way out of Meanwhile, former US president Donald Trump’s trade sanctions on China led to the blacklisting of China’s largest manufacturer of semiconductors, the partially state-owned Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, from buying key components in the US. US President Joe Biden has maintained Mr Trump’s hefty sanctions. The new Aukus defence pact between Australia, the UK and the US – which will see Australia acquire new nuclear-fuelled submarines – has prompted China to accuse western powers of a “Cold War mentality and ideological prejudice”. It is likely to prolong the trade disputes over both Australian coal and US technology. How long will the shortage last? American business executive and engineer, and chief executive of Intel, Pat Gelsinger, has warned that it “could still take a couple of years for the ecosystem to address shortages of foundry capacity”. But some are more optimistic. “We’ve been through this before,” said Constellium Rolled Products chief executive Buddy Stemple, in comments reported by Bloomberg. “Hopefully it’s very focused on supply-chain disruptions that can come back in a satisfactory period of time to keep things moving.” But whether it’s a blip or the advent of a new era, the silicon crisis has exposed how much of modern-day life is literally built on sand. “It’s hard to tell if there will be real shortage or just delays in equipment being delivered,”Bill Mitchell, director of policy at BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, said. “If the normal rules of capitalism work, what will happen is price rises as demand outstrips supply.” Boris Johnson's speech went down a storm.

"Last Updated 6 days ago Analysis: From chips to ships, shortages are making inflation stick By Dhara Ranasinghe and Sujata Rao People refuel their vehicles at a fuel station in London, Britain, September 30, 2021. REUTERS/Hannah McKay Analysts still view price pressures as temporary But watching supply, worker shortages closely U.S. seen more at risk from wage-induced inflation LONDON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Soaring gas prices, staff shortages, a lack of ships -- price pressures globally may be picking up faster than anticipated, challenging the view that inflation will prove transitory. Central bankers, while adamant inflation will subside, are starting to concede it may stay higher for longer as a range of issues push up the prices of goods and services and lift future inflation expectations. Their conclusions will ultimately determine how quickly policymakers unwind the trillions of dollars of monetary stimulus unleashed to ease the COVID-19 crisis. ""Will central bankers be more focused on growth and be a ""bit behind the curve""? Or will they be more concerned about inflation and take the punchbowl away quickly?,"" said Charles Diebel, head of fixed income at asset manager Mediolanum International Funds. Here are five key elements in the inflation debate: European and U.S. gas prices have soared more than 350% and more than 120% respectively this year. Oil is up around 50% and Goldman Sachs expects Brent crude to hit $90 a barrel by end-2021 from around $80 currently. read more Gas and electricity make up 4.8% of the euro area harmonised-inflation (HICP) basket used by the European Central Bank. Rabobank reckons the price surge is a separate 'shock' that could add 0.15 percentage points (ppts) to its 2.2% euro zone inflation forecast for 2021 and another 0.25 ppts to 2022's 1.8% projection. Many economists see higher gas prices as here to stay, due to slowing U.S. output, rising costs of carbon emissions permits for polluters and curbs on the usage of dirtier fuels. In China, where factory inflation hit 9.5% in August, power cuts have slashed output of goods from cement to aluminum. These outages are a risk to end-users such as those in auto supply chains, Morgan Stanley said, noting ""cost-push inflation and tightening upstream supply that could affect downstream production and profits."" Semiconductors, or chips as they are known, are tiny but are having an outsized impact on global factories. At General Motors (GM.N) alone, chip shortages are seen cutting Q3 vehicle deliveries by 200,000, while falling output has sent used-car prices spiraling. Chip prices have risen and semiconductor giant Taiwan's TSMC (2330.TW) is mulling further hikes of up to 20%. That will ripple across everything from electronics to cars and phones to washing machines. But chipmakers themselves face higher input costs from commodities to power. ""It does seem likely that these semiconductor shortages are going to persist into next year,"" said Jack Allen-Reynolds, senior European economist at Capital Economics. Or beyond. Intel's (INTC.O) CEO predicts chips will comprise a fifth of a car's cost by 2030, from 4% in 2019 as vehicles become self-driving or electric. Global food prices rose 30% year-on-year in August, an index compiled by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation shows -- a sign of broadening price pressures. While higher agricultural commodity prices are behind the jump, JPMorgan analysts also attribute food price inflation to pandemic-related pressures such as logistics disruptions and transport costs. In emerging markets, where food makes up a large chunk of inflation baskets, there is more pressure to tighten monetary policy. It is less of a problem for developed nations but price rises look inevitable for items such as soft drinks and snacks. Stringent rules to guide the transition to a greener future are blamed for stoking 'greenflation', for instance by shutting out polluting factories, vehicles, ships and mines, in turn reducing the supply of key goods and services. Prices for European carbon emission allowances, have doubled this year to 65 euros a tonne. A price of 100 euros would lift European retail power prices 12%, adding 35 bps to headline euro zone inflation, Morgan Stanley estimated in June. There are other examples. Falling ship orders due to upcoming rule changes on fuels may be a tailwind for shipping rates that have already surged 280% this year (.BADI). NatWest attributes the commodity rally at least partly to the shift to greener technologies raising mining and production costs. All this may not fully have seeped into inflation calculations. For instance, markets see euro area inflation hitting 2% only after a decade, Danske Bank sees ""upside risks to inflation expectations...once implementation of the green transition gathers momentum"". As prices rise, so do expectations of future inflation among consumers, who accordingly demand pay hikes. The wage growth picture is mixed. U.S average hourly earnings jumped 0.6% in August and U.S. five-year inflation expectations are running around 3%, surveys show. In some UK sectors, earnings have risen as much as 30% this year. Euro area labour costs fell in Q2 but inflation as well as inflation expectations are rising. ""Maybe markets are a little bit extreme in their pricing, but I'm not recommending investors should fade that move,"" Societe Generale senior rates strategist Jorge Garayo said.

What Will Replace Silicon Chips in the Next Generation of EVs? An employee displays a 300mm silicon-carbide wafer. Photo: Bloomberg. As automakers scramble to make electric vehicles with longer ranges and speedier charging times, the chip industry has a message for them: You’re doing it wrong. Semiconductor companies are urging EV makers to ditch traditional silicon chips and embrace materials that will make cars more efficient, helping ease consumers’ “range anxiety” and someday making recharges as quick as a gas-station fill-up. But there isn’t an agreement yet on which approach to use. Silicon carbide is the front-runner, with gallium nitride emerging as a key contender. What are these new materials? Well, silicon carbide — as the name suggests — is a combination of two elements, silicon and carbon. And it does a better job as a power converter, meaning chips using the material can move energy around with less of it getting lost along the way. The same is true of gallium nitride, which is made of gallium and nitrogen and — like silicon carbide — has a distinct edge over traditional silicon. Proponents say it could cut charging time in half.  Choosing the right technology has especially high stakes as the auto industry undergoes its biggest transformation in more than a century. Manufacturers around the world are racing to ditch internal combustion engines, and even icons of the gasoline age like Ford Motor Co.’s Mustang and the GMC Hummer are getting versions with batteries. Along the way, chips have become ever more critical to how a vehicle works, spanning everything from the powertrain to the airbags. That’s become painfully apparent this year as carmakers have had to limit production and leave dealer lots empty because they can’t find enough silicon. But getting automakers on board with the newer technologies is critical to raising EVs to the next level.  “It’s a big learning curve for the carmakers,” said Jean-Christophe Eloy, head of Yole Développement, a semiconductor analysis firm in France. “A good battery, a good inverter and a good electric motor doesn’t give you a good electric car.” The good news, Eloy says, is that Tesla Inc. — a company that prodded the industry to embrace EVs in the first place — could help spur this transition as well.  Tesla is one of the first major adopters of silicon-carbide chips, supplied by STMicroelectronics NV, Eloy said. And Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has touted the technology as a key advantage of his cars. With silicon carbide, watts of power can be crammed into the battery much more quickly, cutting charge times. And it provides for longer ranges because there’s less leakage — wasted power — as a car taps the energy needed to drive motors. Infineon Technologies AG, the biggest maker of automotive chips, expects silicon carbide to exceed more than 30% of the market in electric-vehicle power chips by 2025. “Silicon carbide can bring a significant advantage, literally a 5% to 10% improvement in range,” according to Stephan Zizala, the head of Infineon’s automotive high-power solutions group. The typical reaction at the time: “Why would I do that? It’s crazy.” Some manufacturers are already sold on the concept. General Motors Co. is using silicon-carbide devices in its Ultium EV battery platform, the basis of all of its future electric vehicles. Toyota Motor Corp., which pioneered hybrid vehicles with the Prius, uses silicon carbide in the hydrogen-powered Toyota Mirai, and its supplier Denso Corp. has built the chips into other vehicle lines. Stellantis NV, formed from the merger of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and French rival PSA Group earlier this year, said recently that it may use silicon carbide in power inverters that will be key to mass manufacturing a new generation of electric vehicles globally. But some companies, such as GM, are hedging their bets. They’re also looking at gallium nitride, or GaN, for future use.  Gallium nitride is a newer entrant — and it’s not yet clear what role it will play. Infineon expects it to complement other technologies. Others are positioning it as more of a rival to silicon carbide. BMW AG earlier this month signed a deal to secure $250 million of such chips from GaN Systems Inc. Gallium-nitride chips can cut the time it typically takes to charge a car to 4.7 hours from 11.3 hours, saving 70% on energy in the process. It also could boost the vehicle’s range by 5% and use fewer batteries. That’s according to startup Navitas Semiconductor Inc., which is telling investors that gallium-nitride chips will account for 16% of the power semiconductor market by 2026, up from less than 1% last year. Carmakers have taken years to warm up to the new technologies. When silicon carbide was first offered to auto manufacturers more than a decade ago, they shunned it as “horribly expensive,” said Michael Duhaime, vice president of JJE North America, a Chinese-owned maker of electric drivetrains in Troy, Michigan. The typical reaction at the time: “Why would I do that? It’s crazy,” he said. Now it’s making its way into premium vehicles, where cost is outweighed by the performance benefits.  There are still some painful trade-offs, though. Traditional silicon-based chips are made in the billions each year, and the technology’s 50 years of dominance has created a massive global infrastructure to produce it. That’s brought costs down. Silicon-carbide wafers, the basic material on which the new chips are built, are produced by only a few companies, such as Cree Inc., in a process that’s still difficult and expensive. One obstacle is the material itself, which has to be grown from seed crystals in a chemical process. There are relatively few crystals available that will produce the purity required. Any impurities can result in wafers and chips that are less efficient. In a sign of how scarce the materials are, Cree rival On Semiconductor Corp. agreed to pay $415 million last month for GT Advanced Technologies, acquiring its supplier of silicon carbide. That deal lets it secure access to the raw material. Silicon-carbide components could add an extra $200 to the cost of a vehicle, according to an estimate by Cree. But boosters of the new technology say the cost will quickly be recouped because cars won’t need as many batteries. And that speaks to the need for carmakers to put more thought into the chips they use, Eloy said. “If you want to save costs, if you want to increase range, if you want to do all of this optimization, you need to have your hands in the semiconductors,” he said.

Chief executive Reinhard Ploss says semiconductor order patterns suggest carmakers are aiming to make up for lost production time © Simone Attisani/FT Share on twitter (opens new window) Share on facebook (opens new window) Share on linkedin (opens new window) Joe Miller in Frankfurt OCTOBER 5 2021 The volume of semiconductors being ordered by global carmakers would enable them to build a record amount of vehicles when supply constraints ease, order patterns at Europe’s largest chipmaker Infineon suggest. “If you look at the current demand . . . in the auto industry where we have an excellent transparency to cars manufactured, the current orders look more like 110m to 120m cars [per year],” chief executive Reinhard Ploss told the Financial Times. The previous record was reached in 2018, when 95m cars and vans were delivered to customers, according to Moody’s. Since then, the global car market has shrunk, after being hit by an economic slowdown, the pandemic and the semiconductor supply crisis in quick succession. The current shortage of crucial components, which has led to plants being shut around the world, could lead overall car production to slump to 77m in 2021, according to AlixPartners, almost 8m fewer units than it forecast before the bottlenecks took hold. But Ploss said ordering patterns suggested carmakers might be looking to make up for lost production time in the coming months. “There are many bits and pieces from which we can read the total market,” he said, singling out components such as microcontrollers, which are made for specific models and easy to track. “If these numbers we see are representative, then the total ordering behaviour would represent a car demand between 110m and 120m.” The Bavarian executive stopped short of suggesting that auto customers were stockpiling to prevent further shortages, but warned it was “very difficult to assess” whether this demand would be sustained once the semiconductor crisis eased. “A significant portion [of the orders] is a catch-up and a certain portion is really added demand by buyers,” he said. No easy options to ease semiconductor squeeze Separately on Tuesday, Infineon said it expected revenues for the 2022 fiscal year to rise by a “mid-teens percentage”, assuming exchange rates remained stable, with a “further margin uplift”. The German group also announced it would invest a total of €2.4bn during the year, predominantly in updating equipment, up from a total of €1.6bn in 2021. The former Siemens company last month opened Europe’s newest semiconductor plant in Villach, Austria, which will produce power chips primarily for auto customers. While it was “very likely” that there would be a “phase of strong growth in semiconductors”, Ploss warned that the industry “will definitely not stay on the growth momentum we see today, which is, I think, driven by some specialist topic[s]”. The auto industry accounts for about 8 per cent of the total semiconductor market, but more than 40 per cent of Infineon’s revenues.

Europe plans a Chips Act to boost semiconductor sovereignty Natasha Lomas@riptari / 5:09 PM GMT+6•September 15, 2021 cameraImage Credits: Torsak Thammachote (opens in a new window) (opens in a new window) The EU will use legislation to push for greater resilience and sovereignty in regional semiconductor supply chains. The bloc’s president trailed a forthcoming “European Chips Act” in a state of the union speech today. Ursula von der Leyen suggested that gaining greater autonomy in chipmaking is now a key component of the EU’s overarching digital strategy. She flagged the global shortage of semiconductors, which has led to slowdowns in production for a range of products that rely on chips to drive data processing — from cars and trains to smartphones and other consumer electronics — as driving EU lawmakers’ concern about European capacity in this area. “There is no digital without chips,” said von der Leyen. “While we speak, whole production lines are already working at reduced speed — despite growing demand — because of a shortage of semi-conductors. “But while global demand has exploded, Europe’s share across the entire value chain, from design to manufacturing capacity has shrunk. We depend on state-of-the-art chips manufactured in Asia. So this is not just a matter of our competitiveness. This is also a matter of tech sovereignty. So let’s put all of our focus on it.” The Chips Act will aim to link together the EU’s semiconductor research, design and testing capacities, she said, calling for “coordination” between EU and national investments in this area to help boost the bloc’s self-sufficiency. “The aim is to jointly create a state-of-the-art European chip ecosystem, including production. That ensures our security of supply and will develop new markets for ground-breaking European tech,” she added. The EU president couched the ambition for bolstering European chip capacity as a “daunting task” but likened the mission to what the bloc did with its Galileo satellite navigation system two decades ago. “Today European satellites provide the navigation system for more than 2 billion smartphones worldwide. We are world leaders. So let’s be bold again, this time with semi-conductors.” In follow-up remarks, the EU’s internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, put a little more meat on the bones of the legislative plan — saying the Commission wants to integrate Member State efforts into a “coherent” pan-EU semiconductor strategy and also create a framework “to avoid a race to national public subsidies fragmenting the single market”. The aim will be to “set conditions to protect European interests and place Europe firmly in the global geopolitical landscape”, he added. Per Breton, the Chip Act will comprise three elements: Firstly, a semiconductor research strategy that will aim to build on work being done by institutions such as IMEC in Belgium, LETI/CEA in France and Fraunhofer in Germany. “Building on the existing research partnership (the KDT Joint Undertaking), we need to up our game, and design a strategy to push the research ambitions of Europe to the next level while preserving our strategic interests,” he noted. The second component will consist of a collective plan to boost European chipmaking capacity. He said the planned legislation will aim to support chip supply chain monitoring and resilience across design, production, packaging, equipment and suppliers (e.g. producers of wafers). The goal will be to support the development of European “mega fabs” that are able to produce high volumes of the most advanced (towards 2nm and below) and energy-efficient semiconductors. However, the EU isn’t planning for a future when it can make all the chips it needs itself. The last plank of the European Chip Act will set out a framework for international co-operation and partnership. “The idea is not to produce everything on our own here in Europe. In addition to making our local production more resilient, we need to design a strategy to diversify our supply chains in order to decrease over-dependence on a single country or region,” Breton went on. “And while the EU aims to remain the top global destination of foreign investment and we welcome foreign investment to help increase our production capacity especially in high-end technology, through the European Chips Act we will also put the right conditions in place to preserve Europe’s security of supply.” “The US are now discussing a massive investment under the American Chips Act designed to finance the creation of an American research centre and to help open up advanced production factories. The objective is clear: to increase the resilience of US semiconductor supply chains,” he added. “Taiwan is positioning itself to ensure its primacy on semiconductor manufacturing. China, too, is trying to close the technological gap as it is constrained by export control rules to avoid technological transfers. Europe cannot and will not lag behind.” In additional documentation released today, the EU said the Chips Act will build on other digital initiatives already presented by the von der Leyen Commission — such as moves to contain the power of “gatekeeper” internet giants and increase platforms’ accountability (the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act); regulate high-risk applications of AI (the Artificial Intelligence Act); tackle online disinformation (via a beefed up code of practice); and boost investment in regional digital infrastructure and skills.

"GM's Barra offers more detail on future strategy to solve chips crisis General Motors will look to form strategic partnerships, including joint ventures and long-term agreements, with semiconductor chip makers as it tweaks its strategy to secure more chips, CEO Mary Barra said Tuesday. Barra said the global shortage of chips has forced GM to more closely study its supply chain beyond the ""short-term"" fix of just getting enough chips to keep plants running each week. ""We're also looking at what can we do in the midterm and long term of either having strategic partnerships, in some cases joint ventures like we do with our battery cells, or just having longer term agreements,"" Barra said, referring to GM's joint venture with LG Chem called Ultium LLC. Ultium is the battery system that will underpin the 30 new electric vehicles GM will launch by 2025. Since early this year, the auto industry has been faced with a severe shortage of car parts that use semiconductor chips. Demand for the chips surged during the COVID-19 pandemic when more people were buying personal electronics, which also use the chips. GM and other automakers have had to either idle factories or build cars just shy of all the parts, park them and wait for the parts that contain chips to arrive to complete assembly on the cars. As a result, dealer lots are largely barren.  Barra has said the shortage could cost GM up to $2 billion in lost earnings this year. GM buys ""very few chips"" directly from chipmakers, Barra said. But some newer GM vehicles will have up to 30% more chips. So GM is more closely looking at how it can better source chips for the parts it uses. Barra said GM is now ""communicating far deeper"" into the supply chain to work with those suppliers who do get the chips directly from chip manufacturers than it has previously. ""We’re reevaluating, and having direct relationships, with tier two, three and four suppliers to make sure we’re going to have a secure supply,"" Barra said. Barra made the comments during part of the virtual conference, ""Workday Conversations for a Changing World"" with Fortune CEO Alan Murray. Workday specializes in software that helps in managing people. Earlier this month, Barra had said GM plans to make ""substantial"" changes in its supply chain to address the chips shortage, which she said might continue beyond the initial expectation that it would ease by the second half of the year. A GM spokesman declined to comment beyond Barra's remarks Tuesday. GM CFO Paul Jacobson recently told Wall Street analysts that GM's third-quarter wholesale vehicle deliveries would be down by 200,000 units rather than the initial projection of a 100,000-unit dip due to the chips shortage. But he said GM expects a ""more stable year"" in 2022 for semiconductor supplies. A report released last week by consulting firm AlixPartners said the chips crisis will cost the global auto industry $210 billion in revenues this year. That's almost double its  estimate in May of $110 billion. AlixPartners forecasts that automakers will lose production of 7.7 million vehicles this year. In May, it had forecast a production loss of 3.9 million. Also on Tuesday, Ford Motor Co. CEO Jim Farley told Yahoo Finance the chip shortage will be an issue for the auto industry into 2022.

Tue, Oct 05, 2021 page1 Peace crucial to chip supply: economics minister Peace in the Taiwan Strait is key to Taiwan’s ability to ensure a continuous supply of the chips needed to power a wide range of products from vehicles to smartphones, Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Mei-hua (王美花) said. Taipei is seeking to rally political support as China ramps up its aggression toward Taiwan. Chinese warplanes made a record 93 flights close to Taiwan over a three-day period starting on Friday, prompting the US Department of State to express concern and urge China to cease its “provocative” actions. “Taiwan has helped foster a great chip manufacturing ecosystem with three decades of efforts against the backdrop of globalization,” Wang said in an interview on Friday last week. “The global community should take Taiwan’s security more seriously so Taiwan can continue to provide stable service to everyone and be a very good partner to everyone.” Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Mei-hua speaks during an interview in Taipei on Thursday last week. Photo: Ann Wang, Reuters Wang’s comments highlight the increasingly politicized nature of semiconductors as governments around the world scramble to secure sufficient chips from Taiwan to accelerate an economic rebound post-COVID-19. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC, 台積電) boasts a 53 percent share of the contract chipmaking market, fueling concern that any instability in the Taiwan Strait could cut off supply of chips used by hundreds of companies. TSMC chairman Mark Liu (劉德音) in July also called for peace in the region to prevent disruptions to the supply chain. The heavy reliance on TSMC and its local peers has spurred governments in the US, the EU, Japan and China to mull bolstering their own domestic chip industries. US President Joe Biden’s administration last month stepped up pressure on companies to disclose details of their supply-and-demand structures, as the global chip shortage continued to wreak havoc on many industries, including automaking. Intel Corp CEO Pat Gelsinger said that the US government should prioritize support to domestic US chipmakers, characterizing foreign supply chains as “insecure.” Wang dismissed concerns that companies around the world are too dependent on Taiwan, saying that the country focuses mostly on chip fabrication within the complex global semiconductor supply chain. It still needs equipment and materials from other countries, such as gear from US-based Applied Materials Inc and the Netherlands’ ASML Holding NV, which has a monopoly on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems required for manufacturing the most cutting-edge chips, she said. “We can buy EUV machines only from ASML. Are we going to say that it is too risky for us to be so dependent on ASML?” Wang said. “Taiwan has built a professional and reliable ecosystem over a long period of time, so many chip designers end up getting Taiwan to make the chips. It is really because Taiwan has a very efficient production system. Taiwan actually grows and thrives together with global equipment and material suppliers.” Taiwanese chipmakers are already doing their part to alleviate shortages plaguing the global automotive industry, she said, with TSMC boosting output of automotive microcontrollers by 60 percent from last year. It is also spending US$100 billion to expand manufacturing over three years. However, chip packaging and testing services in Malaysia have been affected by lockdowns, and that is causing the current bottleneck in supply, she said. TSMC produces a significant portion of the semiconductors needed by major auto chip suppliers such as Infineon Technologies AG, NXP Semiconductors NV and Japan’s Renesas Electronics Corp, companies that automakers around the world depend on for essential electronic components for their vehicles. To mitigate US national security concerns, TSMC is building a US$12 billion plant in Arizona with the goal of starting production by 2024. The company is also considering building a fab in Japan and studying the feasibility of a creating a plant in Germany. It is also adding capacity in a fab in Nanjing, China. At home, the Taiwanese government is making efforts to provide TSMC with adequate water and electricity supply in anticipation of the chipmaker’s future needs, Wang said. TSMC has pledged to using 100 percent renewable energy and producing zero indirect carbon emissions from electricity consumption by 2025. “The chip industry has propped up Taiwan’s economy. It is a key pillar to Taiwan’s economic security and overall security,” Wang said. “We are working hard to ensure that Taiwan will continue to be a reliable partner for everyone to collaborate with.” Comments will be moderated.

The International Association for the Development of Apnea (AIDA) removed Taiwan’s flag during a live broadcast of the Individual Depth Freediving World Championship in Cyprus on Tuesday, in which five Taiwanese divers competed. The organization said that it removed the flag after the broadcaster complained that displaying the flag would affect its broadcast of the event, leaving Taiwan as the only one among the 44 participating nations without a flag.

On Friday evening, the Ministry of National Defense reported that 25 Chinese planes had crossed into the nation’s southeastern ADIZ, between Taiwan proper and the Pratas Islands (Dongsha Island, 東沙群島). It identified the planes as 18 J-16 fighter jets, four SU-30 fighters, two H-6 bombers and one Y-8 anti-submarine warfare plane.

Although there was some commentary from automotive companies early in the summer that the semiconductor shortage was showing signs of abating, this clearly doesn’t seem to be the case. Last month, auto majors including Toyota Motors and Ford indicated that they would scale back on production, while the CEO of Volkswagen says that chips could remain in short supply for years to come, while the head of Daimler thinks the shortage won’t be resolved until 2023. While the shortage is partly due to stronger demand for more advanced chips from the consumer electronics and computer industry through Covid-19, semiconductor content in the auto industry itself is surging driven by the adoption of technologies such as driver assistance systems and autonomous driving. Intel projects that semiconductors will account for over 20% of the input costs for new premium cars, up from 4% in 2019. Chip companies are also doubling down on their capital expenditure plans to capitalize on growing chip demand and the current supply constraints. TSMC, the world’s largest semiconductor contract manufacturer, indicates that it would spend about $100 billion over the next three years to bolster production capacity, while the Samsung group intends to spend around $205 billion over the next three years, with a good portion of the funds going toward its chip business. Even Intel wants to double down on contract manufacturing, recently announcing plans to build new chip-making facilities in Europe investing as much as $95 billion over the next decade or so. These investment plans should bode well for equipment manufacturers, who could see demand for more cutting-edge chip production tools. Within our theme, Applied Materials - a supplier of equipment, services, and software used in the production of semiconductor and display products - has been the strongest performer, with its stock price up by 58% year to date. On the other side, memory major Micron Technology has been the weakest performer, with its stock down by about 2%. [8/20/2021] Toyota, Ford, VW Cut Production Due To Chip Shortages. These Stocks Stand To Benefit Our theme on Stocks That Benefit From The Semiconductor Shortage, which includes companies that produce machinery and tools for chipmaking and semiconductor players with their own fab capacity, has returned about 18% year-to-date, roughly in line with the broader S&P 500. Although the theme remains down marginally over the last month, there are multiple near-term and longer-term trends that should benefit the companies in our theme. Who Is The New Platinum Card From American Express Good For? Best Crypto Exchanges For 2021 ByTaylor TepperForbes Advisor Staff Firstly, the global semiconductor shortage may be far from over, causing companies to increase investment in production capacity. While there were signs that the semiconductor shortage in the automotive industry was easing earlier this summer, as major foundry players such as Taiwan’s TSMC noted that auto chip output was slated to increase, recent reports from automakers don’t sound as optimistic. Toyota Motors, the world’s largest car manufacturer by volume, is likely to cut global production in September by 40% from its previous plan due to the semiconductor supply crunch, per a report from Nikkei. Volkswagen also may need to further cut its production, while Ford is expected to idle production for one week at a U.S. plant that manufacturers its popular F-150 trucks, on account of the shortage. The consumer electronics industry is also now feeling the pinch, with Apple indicating that the production of its products such as the iPhone and iPad could be impacted by tight chip supply. Semiconductor demand is also likely to trend higher in the long run. Higher digitization following Covid-19, the 5G upgrade cycle in the wireless market, and the need for more advanced chips for applications such as AI and machine learning, and cloud computing are big levers of semiconductor demand growth. This should also bode well for equipment manufacturers, who could see demand for more cutting-edge chip production tools. Within our theme, Applied Materials has been the strongest performer, with its stock rising by about 50% year-to-date. On the other side, memory major Micron Technology has been the worst performer, with its stock down 6.5% year-to-date. [7/19/2021] With Auto Chip Shortage Easing, Are Semiconductor Equipment Stocks Still A Buy? Our theme on Stocks That Benefit From The Semiconductor Shortage includes companies that produce machinery and tools for chipmaking and semiconductor players with their own fab capacity. The stocks in the theme have had a relatively mixed couple of days, driven by news from TSMC, the largest semiconductor contract manufacturer, which indicated that the automotive chip shortage was likely to ease this quarter as it plans to increase the output of semiconductors that go into vehicles by almost 60% versus last year and by roughly 30% from pre-pandemic levels. However, there are several trends that point to structurally higher semiconductor demand, which should, in turn, drive investments in chip fabrication equipment. Higher digitization following Covid-19, the 5G upgrade cycle in the wireless market, and the need for more advanced chips for applications such as AI and machine learning, and cloud computing are big levers of semiconductor demand growth. Separately, the demand for increasing re-shoring of semiconductor production to the U.S. from overseas could also drive sales. Our theme has outperformed this year, returning 21% year-to-date, compared to a return of 14% for the Nasdaq-100. Within our theme, Applied Materials has been the strongest performer, with its stock rising by about 49% year-to-date. On the other side, memory major Micron Technology has been the worst performer, with its stock remaining roughly flat year-to-date. [7/7/2021] Semiconductor Shortage Stocks The global chip supply crunch has disrupted production in a wide range of industries. Although much of the news about the shortage has been centered on the automotive industry, industries ranging from medical devices to home appliances and consumer electronics continue to see the impact. There doesn’t appear to be a quick solution to the current shortage, and considerable investments into the global semiconductor supply chain will be required in the coming years. Investors can gain exposure to this trend via our indicative theme on Stocks That Benefit From The Semiconductor Shortage - which includes companies that produce machinery and tools for chipmaking and semiconductor players with their own fab capacity. The theme has outperformed this year, returning 27% year-to-date, compared to a return of 16% for the Nasdaq-100. Within our theme, Applied Materials has been the strongest performer, with its stock rising by about 58% year-to-date as investors expect the company, which supplies wafer fab equipment, to be a key beneficiary of rising capital spending by chipmakers. On the other side, memory major Micron Technology has been the worst performer, with its stock price up by just about 7% this year. [6/21/2021] Stocks That Benefit As U.S. Re-Shores Semiconductor Production The global chip shortage, which was brought about by surging demand from the consumer electronics industry and supply-side disruptions, has impacted the production of a range of products ranging from cars to computers over the last few quarters. Investors can stand to benefit from the trend, with our indicative theme on Stocks That Benefit From The Semiconductor Shortage - which includes companies that produce machinery and tools for chipmaking and semiconductor players with their own fab capacity. The theme has outperformed this year, returning 23% year-to-date, compared to a return of 11% for the S&P 500. Now, although the worst of the semiconductor crunch appears to be over for the automotive industry - which bore the brunt of the disruption, we think the theme will continue to outperform in the medium to long term as semiconductor demand is expected to run ahead of supply. Moreover, demand for semiconductor fabrication equipment is also likely to grow, as the U.S. government has been taking steps to protect its chip supply by incentivizing domestic production following the current supply crunch, as well as events such as Covid-19, and the trade war with China. For perspective, the U.S. share of semiconductors production has declined to just 12% down from about 37% share back in 1990 and lawmakers are looking to reverse this trend. Last week, lawmakers introduced a bipartisan bill looking at a 25% tax credit for investments into semiconductor manufacturing equipment and facilities to encourage semiconductor companies to invest in U.S. production. This comes less than a week after the Senate approved about $52 billion in funding for the semiconductor industry, to help the U.S. better take on China. Within our theme, Applied Materials -a supplier of equipment, services, and software used in the production of semiconductor and display products - has been the strongest performer, with its stock price up by 52% year to date. On the other side, memory major Micron Technology has been the weakest performer, with its stock up by just about 2%. [6/7/2021] Chip Shortage Stocks Our theme on Stocks That Benefit From The Semiconductor Shortage - which includes chip companies with their own fabrication capacity and companies that produce machinery and tools for chipmaking - has outperformed this year, returning 30% year-to-date, compared to a return of 13% for the S&P 500. Now although there are some signs that the shortage is easing a bit for the auto sector, with carmakers restarting some production lines they had previously idled, it’s safe to assume that demand for chips will continue to outstrip supply across the board, in the medium term. For example, the CEO of Intel, Pat Gelsinger, expects the shortage to last another two years. There are some other trends that could help the stocks in our theme. Western countries are looking to become more self-reliant with respect to semiconductor production, which is presently dominated by China and other countries in Asia, and this could boost demand for chip fabrication equipment. President Joe Biden’s infrastructure plan also includes $50 billion worth of subsidies for the semiconductor industry and this could also help bolster demand for fabrication equipment. Within our theme, Applied Materials -a supplier of equipment, services, and software used in the production of semiconductor and display products - has been the strongest performer, with its stock price up by 62% year to date. On the other side, memory major Micron Technology has been the weakest performer, with its stock up by just about 11%. Our theme on Stocks That Benefit From The Semiconductor Shortage has returned 28% year-to-date, compared to a return of 13% for the S&P 500. The current chip shortage has gotten more severe over the last few weeks, spreading from the automotive industry which typically relies on legacy, lower margin chips, to more advanced chips used in areas such as consumer electronics. For instance, Apple recently hinted that sales of some of its iPads and Macs could be impacted in the coming quarters by the shortage of chips, while Samsung says that the supply crunch is impacting its television and appliance production. Within our theme, companies that provide tools and machinery for chipmaking have performed the best this year. Investors expect that the current chip shortage and increasing push by the U.S. and the European Union to become more self-reliant with semiconductor production (which is currently dominated by China) is likely to boost demand for chip fabrication equipment. For instance, Applied Materials, Brooks Automation, and LAM Research have seen year-to-date returns of 53%, 35%, and 30% respectively. Semiconductor companies with their own fabrication capacity – which are also part of our theme – have also fared reasonably well with Micron Technology stock up 20%, Intel up 18%, and Skyworks Solutions up 15%. These companies should stand to benefit, to an extent, from the strong demand and price dynamics in the current market, while being somewhat insulated from the supply side constraints. [4/29/2021] Stocks That Benefit From The Semiconductor Crunch The semiconductor industry has been facing a severe supply crunch, driven by surging demand from the consumer electronics industry through Covid-19 and supply-side disruptions including a fire at a fabrication unit in Japan, the freezing weather in the southern United States, and drought in Taiwan. The auto industry is bearing the brunt of the shortfall, with OEMs including Toyota, Volkswagen, and GM having to scale back on production due to a lack of chips, and consumer electronics majors such as Apple are also beginning to feel the pinch. That said, there are a set of companies that stand to benefit from the current shortfall in chip production. For example, semiconductor players who have their own fab capacity stand to gain, as they could see higher price realization without seeing their costs escalate. Moreover, companies that produce tools and machinery for chipmaking should also benefit, as chipmakers expand budgets in order to add more production capacity. For example, Taiwan’s TSMC said it will spend about $100 billion over the next three years to boost capacity, while Samsung Electronics plans to invest $116 billion into boosting production by 2030. Our theme on Stocks That Benefit From The Semiconductor Shortage has returned 32% year-to-date, compared to a return of 12% for the S&P 500. Below is a bit more about some of the stocks in our theme and how they have been performing this year. Applied Materials supplies equipment, services, and software used in the production of semiconductor and display products. The stock has been the strongest performer within our theme, rising about 56% year-to-date, driven by strong demand for semiconductor equipment, and increasing production complexity in the industry. Brooks Automation provides automation, vacuum, and instrumentation equipment for markets including the semiconductor and life sciences industry. The stock is up by about 46% year-to-date as the company is seeing higher demand for its products from the semiconductor space driven by the trends such as the Internet of Things, 5G wireless technology, and machine learning. KLA Tencor is another supplier to the semiconductor production space, focused on process control and yield management solutions. The stock is up by about 25% year-to-date, driven by the current chip shortage, and calls from the U.S. government to strengthen the American semiconductor manufacturing industry. Intel, one of the largest microprocessor makers, is also likely to benefit from the current supply crunch as it operates its own fabs, unlike rivals such as AMD and Qualcomm who are dependent on third parties. The company also recently indicated that it was in talks with companies that design chips for carmakers to produce their chips at Intel foundries. The stock is up 18% this year.

TSMC says chip shortage is a myth, companies have built up inventories October 6, 2021 by David According to an article in TIME magazine, in the current chip shortage situation, part of the shortage may have been artificially created by one or more companies in the chip supply chain. The article looks at TSMC’s role in the global chip manufacturing industry. TIME interviewed TSMC President Mark Liu, who works in the industry, among others. When asked about the automakers’ complaints, they were among the first to suggest TSMC was one of the problems. Because of the various allegations against TSMC, Liu had a team collect data to find out what was going on and which customers were truly out of stock and which customers might be hoarding inventory. There are definitely people stockpiling chips in the supply chain. The result was that TSMC decided to reallocate some production to customers it felt were running low on product, while those who had inventory reduced their allocation of new wafers. Obviously, this was not a popular decision, but given the current situation, it seems fair. Liu said, “There are definitely people hoarding chips in the supply chain,” suggesting that it is not TSMC customers who are the problem, but the middlemen and distributors who are hoarding chips and driving up prices.

Petrol retailers reported that the use of military drivers has helped, but warned that more help is needed to get supplies back to normal. Members of the armed forces helped to tackle the crisis by driving fuel lorries, including restocking a petrol station in Waltham Abbey. Military staff are trained as they refuel the BP garage in Farm Hill Road, Waltham Abbey, Essex this afternoon. Photograph: REX/Shutterstock But petrol prices have hit an eight-year high, driven by rising crude oil prices, after more than a week of shortages at the pumps. Brent crude has hit a new three-year high tonight over $83 per barrel, while gas prices have climbed to new records - driving up the UK’s cost of borrowing. UK firms have hiked prices at a record pace last month, as they passed on increased energy costs and staff wages to their customers. Service sector firms also reported that shortages of staff, raw materials and transport cost them business last month. UK car sales tumbled to their lowest level for any September since 1998, with the shortage of semiconductors crimping demand. Van sales also fell, to their lowest since 2009. UK car sales plunge but electric vehicles soar to record amid fuel crisis Engineering group Melrose reported that its auto clients have been cancelling orders for parts, because they can’t get enough chips to build vehicles. The supply chain crisis has also forced farmers to start culling healthy pigs, due to a lack of abattoir workers to butcher them.

Insurers Direct Line and Churchill resume Covid cover for cancelled trips Oil has continued to climb this evening, with Brent crude hitting $83/barrel for the first time in three years. Victoria Scholar, Head of Investment, interactive investor, says: “The decision by OPEC+ on Monday to stick to its plans to gradually increase output by 400,000 bpd in November until April has propelled oil prices sharply higher again today. “The sharply bullish move, which has seen Brent rally to $83 and West Texas hit the highest since 2014, suggests that there is an imbalance in the market with demand outstripping supply. “Analysts are now eyeing $85 as the next hurdle for Brent with a break above this resistance pointing to the potential for a move towards $90. Brent crude has rallied around 60% year-to-date, contributing to the broader surge in commodity prices, which has seen the Bloomberg Commodity Spot Index top its 2011 peak this week and log an all-time high.” European markets had their best session in 11 weeks today (+1.2%), while the FTSE 100 only saw its biggest rise in a week (+0.94%). FTSE 100 closes higher In the City, the blue-chip FTSE 100 index has closed 66 points higher at 7077, up almost 1% today. Banks led the risers, with Barclays and Lloyds both up around 3.9%, as traders anticipated that interest rates will rise in the coming months (good for bank profitability) in response to rising inflation. Commodities giant Glencore (+3.5%) was also in the risers, along with retailer JD Sports (+3.3%) which announced plans for a share split today. Other European markets also rallied, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index jumping almost 1.2%, and there are gains on Wall Street after yesterday’s losses. David Madden, market analyst at Equiti Capital, says inflation and growth worries are on the rise. Stock markets in Europe and the US are in positive territory after a few days of losses. In recent sessions, traders have been preoccupied by fears of higher inflation, but today equities have rebounded. The gains made today are small when compared with the ground lost in the past week. This time last month, the narrative was very different, because bond yields were relatively low, and inflation wasn’t a major concern. Now there is chatter of persistently high inflation, concerns about lower growth in China and the UK, as well as the possibility of the Fed tapering in early 2022. To an extent, the FTSE 100 has weathered the sell-off reasonably well since BP and Royal Dutch Shell have rallied because of the booming oil market.

In oil terms, it's now trading above $230 per barrel of oil equivalent. pic.twitter.com/5hUnGASH8N And a reminder that during a supply crunch, natural gas prices go parabolic, reaching whatever price is needed to curtail demand. In Oklahoma last winter that price was $999 per million Btu. So some could say that actually current UK prices are cheap. #HockeyStickChart And so should other governments: I said the UK government mostly as I call London home. But Brussels (and every other European capital) should be worried too. Continental European gas prices are the same, inflicting a massive inflationary shock on the economies.

Around 64% of fuel stations in the region worst hit by the crisis had both petrol and diesel available today, up from 62% on Monday, according to the daily survey of forecourts by the Petrol Retailers Association. Just 15% were dry, an improvement on Monday’s 20%. Another 21% were offering either petrol or diesel, up from 18% yesterday. “Today’s figures show the situation is improving further around London and the Southeast,” said PRA executive director Gordon Balmer. But Balmer points out that London and the South East are still lagging, and that there are still shortages in other parts of the country too: “Whilst there has been a significant reduction in dry sites, these areas are still lagging behind in having both grades of fuel available compared to the rest of the UK. “Fuel supplies are increasing across the rest of the country: 86% of sites report having both grades of fuel thanks to steady deliveries and stabilising demand, 3% having only one grade and 11% are dry. “Members are reporting they are now receiving deliveries from military drivers using commercial tankers, however further action must be taken to address the needs of disproportionately affected areas”.

Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF’s managing director, said the most serious obstacle to a full recovery was the vaccine divide between rich and poor nations and warned the global economy could suffer a cumulative $5.3tn loss over the next five years unless it was closed. Speaking ahead of the IMF’s annual meeting next week, Georgieva called on rich countries to make good immediately on their pledges to share stockpiles of vaccines with developing countries. “We face a global recovery that remains hobbled by the pandemic and its impact. We are unable to walk forward properly – it is like walking with stones in our shoes! “The most immediate obstacle is the ‘great vaccination divide’ – too many countries with too little access to vaccines, leaving too many people unprotected from Covid.” IMF cuts global economic forecast as pandemic ‘hobbles’ growth STARTING NOW: Join @KGeorgieva with @SenatoreMonti of @Unibocconi and @paolo_magri of the @ispionline for the Curtain Raiser speech: https://t.co/oubxzyedM5 Updated at 2.05pm BST Hundreds of healthy pigs culled amid UK shortage of abattoir workers Photograph: Peter Muller/Getty Images/Image Source The culling of healthy pigs has begun on British farms, with farmers forced to kill animals to make space and ensure the continued welfare of their livestock, amid an ongoing shortage of workers at slaughterhouses. Pig farmers have been warning for several weeks that labour shortages at abattoirs have led to a backlog of as many as 120,000 pigs left stranded on farms long after they should have gone to slaughter. About 600 pigs have been culled at farms across the country, according to Zoe Davies, the chief executive of the National Pigs Association, who said that culling had begun at a “handful” of farms. “We have moved to stage two,” Davies said. “Stage one was contingency planning and putting pigs in temporary accommodation. Stage two, we have not got any more space and pigs are growing, there are more on farm that we can manage. “You either stop mating sows, which some farmers are doing, or you thin out pigs so the welfare of those on farm isn’t negatively impacted.

As the pandemic gathered pace in March 2020, the travel insurers said they would no longer cover holidaymakers who were forced to cancel their trip if they contracted the virus, or the travel rules changed as a result of Covid. On Tuesday, UK Insurance, the owner of the Direct Line and Churchill brands, reversed its decision and announced its policies would offer extensive Covid-related cancellation cover. The move, which is an example of business returning to something approaching normal in the travel sector, is likely to be followed by the other big insurers....

Speaking to CNBC, Yellen says is it “utterly essential” that the limit on government borrowing is raised by 18th October, when the government will run out of funds. It would be catastrophic to not pay the government’s bills, Yellen explained: It really undermines confidence in the full faith and credit of the United States, or willingness to stand behind our debts and make sure that we pay them. It would hit 50 million seniors expecting social security checks, US troops’ paychecks, and 30 million households waiting for child tax credits. And it would undermine the reputation of US Treasury bills as the safest asset around, which underpins the dollar’s reserve currency status, said Yellen, adding: I fully expect it would cause a recession as well.

Janet Yellen says the U.S. faces a recession if Congress doesn’t address the debt limit within 2 weeks. “It’s utterly essential that this be done.” https://t.co/NITjFBtaHm pic.twitter.com/Z2iT3ODGTs The debt ceiling caps how much money the federal government can borrow, which only Congress has the power to raise or lower. The US treasury has said it will be unable to pay its bills by around 18 October, unless Congress raises the current debt limit of $28.4tn. Failure could trigger the first US default in modern history.

EDITORS' PICK|Oct 4, 2021,04:00pm EDT|3,882 views Arm CEO Simon Segars On The Chip Crisis, A New Computing Era And Nvidia’s $54 Billion Bid For His Company I write about CIOs and the strategic use of technology by businesses. Arm CEO Simon Segars ARM On a sideboard in his office in San Jose, California, Simon Segars, the CEO of Arm, has a 1980s-era Motorola DynaTAC mobile phone on display that’s the size of a small brick. Segars, who became the company’s top executive in 2013 and lives near its U.S. headquarters, picks up the device, which he bought on eBay, and slips off the battery pack to show a visiting reporter line after line of text printed on the back of the phone’s body. They’re basic instructions for how to use it. Over the past few decades, mobile phones have gone from brick to slick, packing huge amounts of computing power into slim packages of brushed metal with touch-sensitive screens. Arm, which was founded in 1990 in a converted barn just outside of Cambridge in the U.K. and still has its global headquarters in the city, may not be a household name, but it’s played a pivotal role in this transition. Its 7,000-plus employees dream up the super energy-efficient processors that are the silicon brains of most of the world’s smartphones and which are also found in everything from autonomous vehicles to cloud-computing servers and supercomputers. Arm doesn’t make chips; instead, it licenses its designs and software development tools to other companies who use them to build and manufacture microprocessors—a business that generated almost $2 billion in revenue in its latest full fiscal year. Over 100 billion Arm-based chips have been shipped by manufacturers in the past five years. The company’s success has attracted some notable suitors: In 2013 Japan’s SoftBank paid $32 billion for Arm and in September 2020 U.S. chip giant Nvidia launched a cash-plus-shares bid for it that’s currently worth $54 billion. The proposed transaction, which has SoftBank’s backing, is being reviewed by regulators in the U.S., U.K., China and the European Union. Arm’s relationships with its 580 licensees around the world, who include chip giants such as Qualcomm, Samsung and Marvell, plus Segars’ role as chair of the Global Semiconductor Alliance, an industry group with some 250 corporate members, give the 53-year-old executive a unique perspective on the chip supply crisis that’s causing chaos in industry after industry. Segars believes there aren’t any quick fixes. “I think it will take a few years for all of the ripples to work their way through,” he says. That suggests a period of prolonged pain for the auto industry, which has been hardest hit by the shortage. Manufacturers such as General Motors, Toyota and Ford have cut back production and, in some cases, idled factories as they struggle to get enough chips for vehicles. Consulting firm Alix Partners estimates that the silicon supply squeeze could cost the auto industry $210 billion in lost sales this year. Part of the problem, according to Segars, is that the swift onset of Covid-19 and fears about the spread of its variants have caused business sentiment to fluctuate wildly. “Everything got tossed up in the air. You know, we’re predicting doom and gloom one minute and glory the next, and then it’s back to doom and gloom.” That’s made it particularly hard for manufacturers to estimate likely demand, which has rebounded faster than expected in some sectors. When carmakers and other companies slashed sales forecasts as the pandemic began, they triggered even deeper cutbacks in suppliers’ production plans—a phenomenon supply chain experts call “the bullwhip effect.” “There’s this amplification of uncertainty as you work your way down the supply chain,” says Morris Cohen, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. Expanding production again isn’t always easy, adds Cohen, especially in the chip industry, where new manufacturing plants cost billions of dollars, take a year or more to build and yet more time to fine tune. Everything got tossed up in the air. You know, we’re predicting doom and gloom one minute and glory the next, and then it’s back to doom and gloom. Simon Segars, CEO, Arm Suspicions that some buyers are hoarding chips have added to the uncertainty. Things have gotten so bad that U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo recently said the Biden administration is considering invoking the Cold War-era Defense Production Act to help identify bottlenecks in the semiconductor supply chain. The law could be used to compel companies to share information about chip stocks and manufacturing or purchasing plans. Segars thinks the industry needs to work harder to fix things itself. “There could be an increase in openness between actors within the [chip] supply chain about what they need, inventory levels, predicted demand and lead time changes,” he says, adding this would help change the dynamic “from a collection of transactional relationships where one side wants to spend the least and the other side wants to make the most.” Looking beyond the current supply crunch, Arm’s boss, who joined the company in 1991 as its 16th employee and has been awarded multiple patents as an engineer, is excited by a series of technological advances that are converging to create huge new markets and money-making opportunities. Artificial intelligence (AI), the rise of 5G wireless connectivity and the proliferation of tiny sensors that collect and share data from machines of all kinds are already transforming many businesses. “This hyperconnected world of things, as opposed to just people carrying smartphones, enables all of this data to get moved. And then AI as a technology helps process and get insight from [it]” says Segars. “I think this opens up a whole new realm of computing”. The pandemic is accelerating the rate of change, as companies collect and analyze more data from offices and factories to ensure workers can return to them safely. That’s led to a spending spree on connected devices such as motion sensors and cameras, many of which use Arm-based chips. The company says 25 billion processors based on its designs were shipped in 2020, a 10% year-over-year increase, and forecasts that 300 billion more will follow over the next 10 years. There could be an increase in openness between actors within the [chip] supply chain about what they need, inventory levels, predicted demand and lead time changes. Simon Segars, CEO, Arm Although there’ll still be a need for general purpose microprocessors, Segars believes more and more chips will be built to handle specific tasks. It’s a shift that’s already playing out in the AI world where specialized semiconductors now power things such as neural networks, or machine learning algorithms loosely modeled on aspects of the human brain and nervous system. “If you [create] a dedicated processor for machine learning, you end up with something way more efficient,” says Segars. A conviction that Arm needs significant new investment to help it seize this and other opportunities led him to negotiate the acquisition deal with Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s charismatic CEO, who’s transformed his company into a semiconductor powerhouse with a $511 billion market cap thanks to its leadership in chips for gaming, AI and other uses. Since the bid was announced last year, its value has risen from $40 billion to $54 billion, as Nvidia’s share price has soared on the back of impressive sales numbers. In August 2020, the company said revenues in its latest fiscal quarter hit a new record of just over $6.5 billion. Segars and Huang have spent the past year proselytizing a marriage between their respective companies and addressing opposition to it. Some Arm licensees such as Qualcomm are concerned the deal will allow Nvidia to restrict their access to Arm’s intellectual property and would prefer that the company pursue an IPO rather than a sale. Segars has said in a blog post that Arm considered a public offering but decided against it because it would lead to a focus on short-term profitability that would harm the company’s ability to innovate. The fate of Nvidia’s bid now rests in the hands of regulators and politicians. The U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority has already conducted an initial review of it. Dr. Andrea Coscelli, the agency’s chief executive, said in August that it has “serious concerns” about the transaction’s potential impact on competition and recommended the U.K. government allow it to scrutinize the bid in even more detail. A decision on whether to proceed with a deeper probe is expected soon. Last month, Nvidia asked the European Union’s antitrust division to begin a review of the transaction, which also needs approvals from U.S. and Chinese regulators. Segars and Huang face geopolitical concerns as well as competition ones. The U.K. has launched a separate national security review of the bid for reasons that aren’t entirely clear, though local opponents of the combination have claimed Nvidia is likely to shift people and knowhow to the U.S., harming the U.K.’s innovation ecosystem. Arm's global headquarters in Cambridge, U.K. HUNDVEN-CLEMENTS PHOTOGRAPHY Then there’s China, where Arm has a significant joint venture that sells to local chipmakers. Over the past few years, the U.S. government has restricted Chinese companies’ access to advanced semiconductor tech from U.S. and foreign suppliers, so the prospect of a British-based firm that provides key intellectual property for Chinese chips being acquired by a U.S. bidder is bound to attract scrutiny from Beijing. “The China angle is the biggest unknown,” says Timothy Arcuri, a managing director at investment bank UBS. In 2018 Chinese regulators declined approval for Qualcomm’s $44 billion deal to acquire NXP Semiconductors and the U.S. company ultimately walked away from the transaction, but in 2019 they cleared Nvidia’s $6.9 bid for Israeli chip design firm Mellanox Technologies, which has significant operations in China. Arm and Nvidia now face the task of convincing skeptical licensees, regulators and politicians that their competition and/or security concerns are misplaced—a process that could run well into 2022, if it isn’t derailed beforehand. Both companies argue that by combining their forces, they can produce more innovations, bring them to market faster and reach a greater combined audience of developers. Nvidia has also publicly committed to maintaining Arm’s open-licensing model and to making significant investments in R&D in the U.K. “We think that the pure merits of this deal are really, really strong,” says Segars. “And we’re spending a lot of time explaining to regulators where Arm sits in the industry and how this [combination] is going to create more dynamism in the market.” Those explanations will help determine whether Arm’s boss eventually gets to put a plaque commemorating the successful completion of Nvidia’s bid alongside the DynaTAC sitting on his San Jose sideboard.

Apple has scaled down its chip orders for older-generation iPhones, while ramping up wafer starts at TSMC for its iPhone 13, the sources said. Apple has also not made any changes to its chip orders placed with TSMC for 2021, the sources noted. Apple continues to sell the iPhone 12, iPhone 12 mini, and iPhone 11 on its online store, and also offers the iPhone SE 2 for users who prefer an affordable ‌iPhone‌ with a Home button. Apple discontinued the ‌iPhone‌ XR, ‌iPhone 12‌ Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max when it launched the ‌iPhone 13‌ series in September. Apple is currently struggling with shipment delays on all configurations of ‌iPhone 13‌ models, with three- to four- week delays in shipments in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Older-generation models aren't doing that much better, either. As of writing, online ‌iPhone 12‌ and 12 mini orders face a one- to two-week shipping delay, while ‌iPhone 11‌ orders face an up to five-week delay. During Apple's last earnings call, CEO Tim Cook warned that industry-wide shortages could be impacting ‌iPhone‌ production in the coming months, while increased demand for the latest iPhones could well be exacerbating supply issues. Analyst reports suggest ‌‌iPhone 13‌‌ orders have seen strong early demand, with minimal near-term component headwinds for the devices suggesting lengthy delivery estimates are a result of high demand rather than low supply. According to today's report, TSMC is still on track to move its 3nm process technology to volume production in the second half of 2022, with monthly output for the process set to reach 55,000 wafers. TSMC's 3nm process will reportedly be first adopted for the manufacture of ‌iPhone‌ chips. A previous report from Nikkei Asia claimed Apple will debut the next-generation 3nm chip technology in a 2022 iPad Pro. The A15 Bionic chip in the ‌iPhone 13‌ uses a 5nm+ process, which TSMC refers to as N5P, a ""performance-enhanced version"" of its 5nm process that delivers additional power efficiency and performance improvements. The A16 chip in 2022 iPhones is expected to be manufactured based on TSMC's future 4nm process.

If Apple is indeed not making the iPhone 14 Mini based on iPhone 12 Mini sales, I think it's a mistake. The iPhone 12 Mini launched in a year where people didn't go outside so they didn't want a small phone. And it launched with poor battery. The iPhone 13 Mini will launch in a year where people can actually go outside and it fixed the battery life issue.

"Here's Why the Chip Shortage May Hurt Chipmakers Like NXP and TSMC in 2023 The industry may be overreacting to the current semiconductor undersupply, setting up a swing to the other extreme in two years. Oct 4, 2021 at 7:15AM IDC projects the semiconductor shortage will peak in 2022, when capacity finally matches demand. Moody's fears a swell of semiconductor foundry expansions in China could result in a chip glut. Texas Instruments may have already subtly hinted that a slowdown is starting to take shape. On the off chance that you're unaware, the world is in the grips of a microchip shortage. Technology-intensive goods ranging from automobiles to smartphones to solar panels (just to name a few) are being adversely impact by the supply crunch. Semiconductor manufacturers like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) are working hard to catch up with demand, including investing in new production capacity. But it's still not been enough. The end result? Microchip makers can pretty much charge whatever they want for their wares, yet revenue is still crimped by a lack of inventory. The response to the supply shortage, however, could be setting up a huge future problem that's difficult to see in the present. Namely, the massive investments being made in greater production potential right now set the stage for a price-killing chip glut in 2023. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. A self-induced glut awaits That's the argument being made by technology market research outfit IDC, anyway. Late last month the company said this year's likely 17.3% growth of the undersupplied semiconductor market would ""normalize and balance"" by mid-2022. Then, in 2023, there's a ""potential for overcapacity"" as ""larger scale capacity expansions begin to come online toward the end of 2022."" It admittedly sounds a bit insane, given the current environment and shortage rhetoric. But know that IDC isn't the only organization warning the world of this possibility. Bond and equity markets research name Moody's is worried too. In August a report published by Moody's on the matter explained, ""The [Chinese] government's semiconductor industry investment plans could lead to fierce competition, resulting in overcapacity of certain types [of chips]."" That report went on to warn that ""overcapacity is a particular risk at the fabrication stage as a result of the large amount of capital spending needed to set up fabrication plants."" Although Moody's specifically pointed to China's role in expanding the industry's output, it's hardly going to be solely responsible for any oversupply issue. Intel is spending $20 billion to build two new semiconductor foundries in Arizona and has earmarked nearly $100 billion to expand its chipmaking capacity in Europe. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is planning to spend $100 billion over the course of the next three years to beef up its output volume. Samsung (OTC: SSNLF) is ponying up more than $200 billion to expand its capacity. At least one big name in the industry may somewhat see the prospective problem, however. That name is Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN). Its third-quarter guidance issued as part of its second-quarter report posted back in July wasn't exactly better than expected. More notably, although the company already has a great deal of production capacity, Q3's revenue guidance of between $4.40 billion to $4.76 billion isn't remarkably better -- given the high-demand and COVID-crimped supply at the time -- than last year's Q3 revenue of $3.82 billion. The outlook loosely suggests the headwind is already starting to blow. As Raymond James analyst Chris Caso put it, ""management likely suffers from a lack of confidence at the macro level, despite what clearly continues to be tight supply conditions,"" perhaps articulating the impending challenge in a way that Texas Instruments itself couldn't. Think ahead, because stock prices are forward-looking OK, fine. Too much semiconductor manufacturing capacity is on the horizon, but it won't be a problem for at least a year, and possibly two years. These names are poised to perform well in the meantime, right? Maybe. Or maybe not. While the demand is clearly solid and the need for chips isn't likely to ebb anytime soon, the stock market doesn't operate so straightforwardly. It's predictive in nature, meaning stocks have a way of reflecting what's likely to happen in the future as much as (if not more than) what's happening in the present. And there's the rub. A chip glut is probably part of our foreseeable future, even if we don't know exactly when it will become readily evident. IDC reckons equilibrium will be found sometime next year, but a year is a long time. Investors as a group could see that writing on the wall anytime between now and then, and start repricing these stocks accordingly. Bottom line? This isn't a call to sell any and all foundry/fab names right now, to be clear. It is a suggestion, however, to go ahead and put this brewing headwind on your mental radars. Once it starts to blow against these stocks, it could stiffen in a hurry. 10 stocks we like better than Intel Corporation When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Mark Liu told TIME that he was forced to assess the data to establish which TSMC customers were stockpiling. Because more chips were being sent to customers than were being sold on in products, such as smartphones and games consoles, TSMC data indicated to Liu that “there are people definitely accumulating chips who-knows-where in the supply chain”. Liu said that TSMC has rerouted semiconductors to customers that were truly in need of them. “Sometimes [customers] may not be satisfied, but we just have to do what’s best for the industry,” Liu said. The semiconductor shortage began to affect industries in earnest in early 2021 but it traces its origins back to 2020. Chinese companies had begun stockpiling semiconductors over fears that they would end up on a US trade blacklist, as happened to Shenzhen-headquartered Huawei. The networking vendor has been ostracised by much of the West because of its ties to the Chinese state and accusations that it assists Beijing’s intelligence agencies with espionage. Following the outbreak of the West-vs-China trade wars, at the end of 2020 carmakers found themselves at the back of the queue for chips after cancelling orders due to slumping sales at the onset of the pandemic. Severe weather and factory fires compounded the chip shortage at a time when demand for consumer electronics was going up. Nearly all major automakers have been forced into sporadic production line closures over the past ten months because they could not source enough semiconductors. According to Liu, car companies blamed TSMC for the shortage. “But I told them, ‘You are my customer’s customer’s customer. How could I [prioritise others] and not give you chips?’” Liu said. He added: “We are learning too, because we didn’t have to do this before.” With semiconductor supply issues widely expected to continue into 2022, there have been calls from industry players for a fresh approach to supply chains. General Motors will make “some pretty substantial shifts” in its supply chain, the US automaker’s CEO recently said. In May, the CEO of chip-manufacturing equipment supplier Applied Materials said the shortfalls showed just-in-time models “may not be the most effective strategy going forward”. The month prior Jensen Huang, CEO of GPU maker Nvidia, called for a simplification of supply chains in the automotive sector. TSMC, or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, is the dominant player in global chip production. Its fabrication plants build more than half the world’s made-to-order semiconductors, with chip designers such as AMD and Nvidia among its customers. TSMC’s dominant position in manufacture – and its close proximity to China – has sparked political reactions in the US and the European Union. Earlier this year US President Joe Biden allocated $50bn to improve American chipmaking capabilities, and the EU has created a semiconductor alliance to improve competitiveness and “increase Europe’s digital sovereignty”. But with fabrication plants, or fabs, taking years to construct and costing hundreds of billions of dollars, it is unlikely that TSMC’s supremacy will be challenged by such investment in the short term. According to a GlobalData report, the semiconductor industry is “at the start of a 10-year reset in the wake of the pandemic, geopolitical turmoil, and the resulting global shortage”. China too has invested billions of dollars into building chipmaking capacity – with mixed results. Liu added that a softening of trade tensions between the US and China could help ease the chip problem: “The US and China need to understand that they may not be friends, but they are not enemies either. “We need common rules to … give people some expectation about how to do business.” Get important industry news and analysis sent to your inbox – sign up to our e-Newsletter here Decrypting the latest technology news Sign up to our e-Newsletter here © Copyright 2021 Verdict Media Limited.

"SKIP TO MAIN CONTENT MarketWatch Site Logo A link that brings you back to the homepage. .mwA1{fill:#ffffff;} .mwA2{fill:#4db74d;} Opinion: These chip companies will benefit most as the industrial age segues to semiconductors Published: Oct. 5, 2021 at 2:38 p.m. ET Semiconductor companies used to undergo booms and busts. Now there are stable profits as demand booms from almost every sector of the global economy. A semiconductor clean room in Germany. (Photo by JENS SCHLUETER/AFP via Getty Images) The world’s thirst for technology has never been greater than it is today. The pandemic folded years of tech transformation into a matter of months. As a result, there was outsized growth for tech companies that could enable others to reimagine service delivery amid lockdowns. Anything that could fuel e-commerce, remote work, faster or more robust connectivity, or greater security boomed.  More than 18 months since the onset of the pandemic, some of the most popular Covid-19 trades have settled. Consider Peloton PTON, +1.75% and Zoom Video ZM, -1.39%. While software as a service (SaaS), meeting technologies, smart fitness and e-commerce received credit for any semblance of normalcy during the pandemic, it was semiconductors that made it all possible. And our growing dependence on chips to enable our world is creating a sector poised for continued growth, stability and returns, with more boom and less bust than ever before.  At the end of this column, I briefly discuss the semiconductor companies that I believe will benefit most from a transformation in the global economy. Something new: stable profits I’ve heard increasing chatter over the past several months comparing semiconductors to industrials. It’s a vote of confidence that the semiconductor industry as a whole is more robust and stable than ever before, especially amid the current upcycle. The data indicate that semis are set to perform better than industrials. There’s a 50% pre-tax margin on every dollar of sales expected from the semiconductor industry this year and, over the past two decades, a massive three-fold expansion of free cash flow margins. This, coupled with faster revenue growth than industrials, further proves the strengthening stability profile of semis. Knowing that the demand for semiconductors continues to rise, the current sector outperformance of around 48% seems more than likely to be leaving a runway for further growth for the industry’s leaders in revenue, margin, free cash flow and share price — all of which should inspire further confidence in investors.  A leading indicator: the chip shortage itself The ongoing shortage has provided a red flag for some investors and analysts.  The pandemic exacerbated weakness in the global semiconductor supply chain. We have seen lead times for chips nearly double since the pandemic began. This created shortages with certain process technologies needed to deliver finished goods, such as automobiles, notebooks, printers and other semiconductor-dependent goods.

SUBSCRIBE NOW: US $1 FOR 4 WEEKS With the U.S. offshoring the vast majority of its semiconductor manufacturing over the past several decades, we have seen Asia, especially Taiwan, fill the gaps and enable the growth of leading fabless semiconductor companies including Nvidia NVDA, +0.53%, AMD AMD, +1.16% and Qualcomm QCOM, -0.17%.   On the other hand, the outsourcing of semiconductor manufacturing, especially the strength of fabless chipmakers, has played a significant role in the shortage. Over the past few years we’ve seen the likes of AMD gain 15% market share in high-performance computing. Much of this newly gained market share came from Intel INTC, -0.38%, which means the manufacturing moved from Intel fabs to Taiwan Semiconductor TSM, -0.20%. This is just one of these types of instances that has seen fab capacity move offshore, putting further strain on manufacturing in Taiwan.  We are now reeling to solve the supply issues and macroeconomic risks associated with our overdependence on Taiwan. This is becoming an even greater concern with the growing tensions between China and Taiwan.  The U.S., as part of its review of supply chain deficiencies, seeks to make a $52 billion investment in shoring up manufacturing with a focus on repatriating more production. However, these investments will take time to improve production capacity. Still, they could strengthen prospects for Intel, which has doubled down on its manufacturing with the announcements of its expanded Intel Foundry Services, which expects to manufacture more chips domestically for fabless chipmakers including several of its larger competitors and to take on a greater role in manufacturing for designs using Arm, as opposed to just x86.  Demand from almost every sector  While the shortage will remain ever-present for parts of the semiconductor industry for at least the next 18 to 24 months, the work being done to stabilize production should enable manufacturing to support growing chip demand once again. Meanwhile, as the economic growth cycle continues to fuel semiconductor-supported innovation, revenues, margin, cash flow and shareholder returns all stand to grow materially.  The semiconductor industry is an underlying catalyst for growth across almost every sector, from banking to health care to retail and manufacturing. Secular trends like remote work, smart cities, 5G and ambient intelligence all depend on the continued innovation of the semiconductor industry. Meaning, the entire industry, from materials to substrates and from designer to fab, is set to experience a run of stable growth, robust innovation and market outperformance that has historically evaded the industry. And if we can quickly solve the lingering issues in our supply chain, the future for the semiconductor industry may be even brighter. Based on the current landscape, I believe there are exciting companies in the sector that stand to benefit significantly from the extended boom in the space. And while many of these companies compete across subsectors, there are standouts in these areas that are likely to outperform. The rise of 5G will greatly benefit Qualcomm in its core handset business and its adjacencies, while the growing interest and need to repatriate semiconductor manufacturing should be a growth engine for Intel and its foundry strategy. I see Nvidia continuing to leverage the growth of AI to accelerate its own growth, while Marvell Technology MRVL, +6.60% capitalizes on its innovation in the data processing space (DPU), and AMD continues to make further inroads in workstations and gaming.

Researchers develop a method for creating unique IDs in chips 04-10-2021 |   |  By Robin Mitchell Researchers from the National Institute of Standards and Technology have recently developed a unique doping technology for creating unique IDs on semiconductors. What challenges do electronic supply chains face, what did the researchers developed, and will unique IDs catch on? What challenges do electronic supply chains face? Developing an electronic product for use by the general public is no small feat. The product in question will most likely be required to meet a series of strict regulations, have a minimum level of reliability, and be reproducible (i.e. for the sake of production). It is these many factors that make every decision involved with electronics design equally important, and this includes the component selection stage. For example, a circuit in the automotive industry must handle a level of vibration and shock not usually experienced by other markets (such as the home and office). To ensure this, components used in automotive designs need to be automotive-grade, which can withstand environments commonly found in automotive applications. Component selection is not the only challenge faced by engineers; component sourcing is also a critical step. Costs of electronic designs are often susceptible, and choosing one resistor over another for a fraction of a penny can translate to thousands of pounds when mass-produced. However, simply selecting a component supplier because it offers lower prices is not always a good idea, and can, in fact, lead to disaster. Many components on the market being offered at low prices are counterfeit parts and/or unreliable stock. This is a common problem in the IC industry where rejected dies are put into the packaging and sold as new, older ICs are rebranded as a newer part, or ICs that outright don’t work are marketed as being functional. Suppose these parts find their way into the supply chain. In that case, manufacturers can face significant challenges as entire batches of products can be scrapped, or worse, lawsuits from customers who may have relied on their design for critical applications. Therefore, ensuring that components are legitimate from authorised sellers is an essential part of the production process, but trying to check that the suppliers are authentic and their sources is a challenging task. Researchers develop doping method for semiconductor IDs1 Recently, researchers from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the US have developed a new method for creating unique IDs for semiconductors that could allow for supply chain management and tracking. Currently, ICs can have unique IDs (UIDs) embedded into their memory or etched onto their casing. Still, these methods can be defeated with the use of programmers or laser engraving systems. Furthermore, the use of the programmed method does not work on ICs that do not integrate processors (such as analogue ICs). The researchers used an atomic force microscope to dope silicon dies with a unique pattern of atoms into the silicon structure to combat this. While this method could be achieved by doping the entire wafer during production, using an atomic force microscope is cheaper and allows each IC to be uniquely identified. Reading the stored UID is done using a directed radio wave; upon being exposed to radio waves, the IC emits a unique radio frequency pattern. Any changes to the arrangement of the dopants will change the resultant radio wave, making it next to impossible to be cloned in a counterfeit device. Will unique IDs become more popular? There is no doubt that as technology improves and the costs to implement UIDs decrease, UIDs will become more popular. Their ability to create chains of trust will help to produce products whose integrity can be assured. Furthermore, the use of open databases that store each parts signature can allow manufacturers to check if a part has been used in another circuit previously. UIDs can also help with the fight against e-waste by ensuring that those who own electrical devices properly recycle them. For example, a chip with a UID can be tracked from fabrication to the end device. If this device is found in the trash, the device owner can be found. Furthermore, the company who manufactured the device could be handed back the device for proper recycling. Online documentation could be tied to such devices on their contents and how best to recycle them. Of course, such UIDs will most likely be limited to high-end semiconductors and expensive, bulky components; components such as resistors and capacitors will be far too cheap to tag. But this may become irrelevant as preamble hardware becomes more popular and the dependency on external components is reduced.

Auto sales nosedive in Q3 as inventories dwindle, supply shortages worsen Things have been dicey all year, but the chip shortage in particular is taking its toll Oct 5th 2021 at 12:44PM U.S. car sales have dipped to levels not seen since the Great Recession as ongoing supply shortages hamper automotive production worldwide, strangling inventories while dealers attempt to salvage whatever revenue they can by increasing margins on the few vehicles they're able to stock.  Even a careful perusal of Q3 and September sales figures (Automotive News subscription required) reveals virtually no good news; even Toyota's slight improvement is tenuous at best. While many raw materials and basic components have been in short supply since the pandemic crippled worldwide logistics, the primary culprit in the ongoing automotive production slowdown is computer chips. While some have been quick to point fingers at electric vehicles and other high-tech offerings, the shortage hasn't really discriminated. As of the end of September, the industry is still up more than 13% compared to a year ago, but there's a catch: Sales through Q3 of 2020 were heavily impacted by pandemic-related lockdowns. Retail customers stayed home unless they absolutely had to and rental fleet demand plummeted to nearly zero as vacationers and business travelers canceled in droves. In other words, a 13% bump from 2020 is nothing to write home about. For better context, we can look another year into the past. By this point in 2019, nearly 13 million new vehicles had been sold in the United States. In 2021, that number is just 11,446,866 – a decline of more than 10%. And with the chip shortage still raging, things will only get worse before the end of the year, because while a 10% decline may not sound too dramatic, the real issue is the trend line. At the end of Q1, sales were up nearly 12% over 2020 – a figure largely immune from the impacts of last year's lockdowns. At the end of the second quarter, that figure had climbed to more than 29%. April, May and June were some of the hardest hit by lockdown restrictions last year, which explains the huge improvement in 2021. Unfortunately, the recovery pace is not currently sustainable, as dealers simply don't have cars to sell.  The situation has thrown the entire sales landscape off-kilter. Toyota sales have been outpacing those of perennial number-one seller General Motors as the latter struggles to build key volume models, including the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra, both of which have faced idled production due to parts shortages. The same has been true at Ford, which has sidelined production of its F-Series pickups more than once in recent months.  For customers, the end result is that affordable new cars are incredibly few and far between. Transaction prices started skyrocketing early this year before inventory situations became truly dire and used options are often even worse. With no end in sight, it could be a tough holiday season for car shoppers.

EDITORS' PICK|Sep 19, 2021,08:16am EDT|2,377 views Chip-Threatened Automakers Sell Less, But Profit More Aerial view of new cars lined up at Industrial factory Port with Roll on Roll off (RoRo) carrier for ... [+] GETTY Demand for new cars in Europe is strong although slowing, and automakers must be laughing all the way to the bank right? Well no, because despite a clamor for new cars unleashed after the coronavirus lockdowns came to an end, production is being hampered by a shortage of crucial semiconductor chips, so that’s bad. Again, not really, because the product shortages mean the big auto manufacturers aren’t having to compete against each other for every sale, and so can gouge top profit margin dollars out of every sale. “Isn’t (the auto business) a funny industry – the fewer cars manufacturers sell, the more money they make,” said Bernstein Research analyst Arndt Ellinghorst in a report. And the sales growth slowdown is set to continue for the rest of the year, according to LMC Automotive, as it cut its forecast for Western Europe again. In its report on the first 8 months of the year, LMC Automotive said sales for the year will only rise 2.5%, compared with its month previous forecast of a 3.0% gain and July’s prediction they would jump 9.6% in 2021. For the first 8 months the annual selling rate was 11 million vehicles a year, which sounds a lot until you remember before coronavirus struck the annual selling rate was well over 14 million. The market is now weakening because of the semiconductor shortage. “While the pandemic is not over in the region, the single biggest challenge facing the industry is now the auto chip shortage, which is currently constraining vehicle (sales) due to the lack of availability of vehicles, and those that are available being higher priced. With the current challenges likely to continue well into next year, we have lowered our near-term outlook in recent months, only seeing a more pronounced pick up in selling rates over the course of the second half of next year when supply constraints ease,” LMS Automotive said in a report. The chip shortage will get worse before it gets better, said Fitch Solutions, and will only start to improve in 2022. This is because the Delta Covid-19 variant will continue to disrupt chip production in Asia, it said. “We still only expect an overall improvement in the global supply of chips from mid-2022 onwards as new chip production capacity starts to come online. However, there will still be a shortage to some extent until mid-2023,” Fitch Solutions said. Who Is The New Platinum Card From American Express Good For? September 2020 FOMC Meeting: Fed Minutes Confirm Committee's New Outlook On Rates Data firm IHS Markit INFO +0.4% expects the global chip shortage to extend well into next year and cut its global car and SUV production forecast by 5 million this year to 78.5 million and to 82.6 million for 2022, cuts of 6.2% and 9.3%. Investment bank Morgan Stanley MS -0.1% said the automotive industry remains hostage to a lack of semiconductors. “The situation has gone from ‘fluid’ to downright inexplicable. If semi supply is recovering in aggregate, why does this remain such an issue for autos,” Morgan Stanley said in a report. “How long will this last? When will things return to normal,” the report asked, adding acute tightness will last through 2021, with normality not being restored until the 2nd half of 2022. “It’s quite possible that just as the chip shortage situation came upon the industry in a sudden and unpredictable manner, its recovery may also come in a sudden and unpredictable way,” the report said. Bernstein Research pointed out the combination of the coronavirus pandemic and shortage of chips forced fewer vehicles to made and lifted pricing and second hand market prices, with first half margins the highest in automotive history. But the report pointed to some investors believing fundamental performance will deteriorate because the industry will quickly revert to chasing sales once bottlenecks disappear. “We believe this is an overly cynical and depressing view on the industry and its management teams. Our boardroom conversations suggest that supply/demand and vehicle pricing are at the very top of (manufacturers) agenda,” the report, headlined “Premium Pricing – Can you please not mess this up!”, said. But investment bank UBS said it was hearing much cautious comment about the current quarter, with production recovery likely to take longer than initially anticipated. “While the unprecedented price/mix situation for (manufacturers) will likely continue for longer, supporting strong margins, the loss of volume in the 3rd quarter is likely to lead to a sequential decline in profitability compared with the first half,” UBS said in a report.

"Becker's Healthcare: Hospital ASC Spine Clinical Health IT CFO Dental + DSO Payer Career Center Medical devicemakers plea for computer chips in global shortage: 6 things to know Hannah Mitchell - Monday, October 4th, 2021 Print  | Email Medical devicemakers are highlighting that their products are life-saving in a global chip shortage where competition is steep, according to an Oct. 3 report by The Wall Street Journal. Six things to know: Some hospitals are experiencing monthslong delays for CT scanners, telemetry monitors, defibrillators and more as lead times for chips increased from three months to 15 months, the Journal reported. Mike Arena, vice president of operations for Fujifilm SonoSite, which makes portable ultrasound machines, told the Journal when his company goes to chipmaker executives, they want to help. ""Nobody wants to be the person who shuts down critical medical devices in the middle of COVID,"" he said. Mr. Arena told the Journal that medical devicemakers are competing for parts against companies that generate hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Fujifilm recently paid a broker $65 for a part that usually costs $1.49, because chips are in short supply. ""What I’m asking them is to take some components from your higher-revenue customers and give some to me so you can do something good for the world,""  Mr. Arena told the Journal. Boston Scientific is also leveraging its product importance for patients when competing for chip allocation. By doing so, the medical device manufacturer has kept up with demand, but the company is ""flying closer to the sun than [it would] like to see,'' Brad Sorenson, senior vice president of supply chain, told the Journal. Mick Farrell, CEO of ResMed, which makes ventilators and other breathing aids, is leading with a human element to secure chips. He tells chipmakers, ""Every single chip you give me gives the gift of breath to a person suffocating,"" the Journal reported. Copyright © 2021 Becker's Healthcare. All Rights Reserved.

DOW JONES, A NEWS CORP COMPANY The Wall Street Journal MARKETS HEARD ON THE STREET The Great Car-Chip Shortage Will Have Lasting Consequences Semiconductors have become a strategic component for car makers. First they will increase inventories, then some might design their own. The number of semiconductors in a modern car, from the ignition to the braking system, can exceed a thousand. As the global chip shortage drags on, car makers from General Motors to Tesla find themselves forced to adjust production and rethink the entire supply chain. Illustration/Video: Sharon Shi Sept. 27, 2021 6:10 am ET The once-obscure world of automotive microchips will never be the same again. It has been a difficult month for the car industry. Manufacturers such as Toyota and General Motors have announced sweeping reductions to their fall production schedules for want of parts, particularly semiconductors. Consulting firm AlixPartners said Thursday that the chip shortage would likely cost the industry $210 billion in lost revenues this year, which was almost double its May estimate.

The remarks by the chipmaking giant are the latest response to Washington's request that chip suppliers and electronics makers share information on their supply chain in order to address an unprecedented global chip shortage. The move has sparked concern among companies like TSMC, who say such information constitutes highly sensitive trade secrets. ""We will definitely not leak our company's sensitive information, especially that related to our customers,"" Sylvia Fang, TSMC's general counsel, told reporters on Wednesday when asked how the world's largest contract chipmaker sees Washington's move. ""We are still at the stage of doing some preliminary research and evaluating the contents of the questionnaire [sent by the U.S. government],"" Fang said, adding that TSMC believes there are ways to address the questionnaire without compromising confidential client information. The U.S. government ""also realized that a lot of companies have questions so they are preparing a FAQ sheet, and we are waiting for that too,"" Fang said. TSMC, the world's biggest contract chipmaker, supplies nearly all the world's key chip developers, including Apple, Qualcomm, Broadcom, Intel, Sony and Nvidia. Washington has given global chipmakers and electronics device makers until Nov. 8 to voluntarily send in information on inventories, production capacity, and who their key customers are for specific products. The questionnaire posted on the Federal Register, a U.S. government website, includes at least 13 main questions for semiconductor manufacturers, chip developers, and packaging and testing service providers. They are asked, among other things, to list ""each product's top three current customers and the estimated percentage of that product's sales accounted for by each customer."" Other questions ask respondents to list products ""with the largest order backlog"" and the amount of sales for those products. Following the latest meeting with chip industry leaders, U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo on Sept. 23 said the Biden administration is considering using a Cold War-era national security law to force companies in the chip supply chains to provide key data if they do not respond to the request to voluntarily fill out the questionnaire within 45 days. ""What I told them is, 'I don't want to have to do anything compulsory but if they don't comply, then they'll leave me no choice,'"" she said in a Reuters interview. The U.S. request has already sparked major concern among the industry and the public over the protection of trade secrets and business competitiveness, as well as the impact on customer trust. TSMC's local investors even filed for a provisional injunction to Taiwan Hsinchu District Court asking that the chipmaker not be allowed to send critical trade secrets to the U.S. Taiwan's National Development Council Minister Kung Ming-hsin oversees the National Development Fund, TSMC's single largest shareholder, with a more than 6% stake. Kung said the U.S. request is aimed not only at TSMC, or even just Taiwanese suppliers, but at all the companies involved in the chip supply chain. Kung, who also serves as a TSMC board director, said that based on a preliminary assessment of the U.S. government's questionnaire, there should be room for answering the questions without compromising the confidential information of TSMC's clients. In addition to the U.S. request, TSMC's Fang also discussed the company's automotive chip output, saying the company continues to prioritize such chips. Previously, TSMC said it would increase output for automotive chips by 60% for 2021, compared with a year ago.

Skip to main content Yueqi Yang | Bloomberg News September 20, 2021 10:15 AM, EDT GM Plans ‘Substantial Shifts’ in Supply Chain as Chip Shortage Persists [Stay on top of transportation news: Get TTNews in your inbox.] General Motors Co. is planning to revamp its supply chain as the pandemic-triggered chip shortage and rising demand for chip-intensive vehicles have demonstrated the need for an overhaul. The Detroit-based carmaker will make “substantial shifts” in its supply chain, CEO Mary Barra said Sept. 17 in a live-streamed discussion with Delta Air Lines Inc. CEO Ed Bastian. While GM generally doesn’t buy chips directly, the company is now “building direct relationships” with manufacturers. “It’s a solvable problem, but it’s going to be here a little longer,” Barra said. The semiconductor shortage reflects idiosyncrasies of the global economy in the pandemic and planning decisions made by automakers in the early days of the crisis. But, Barra said, the challenge is also demand-based, with a shift in consumer preferences for vehicles that are becoming more of a software platform. “We didn’t estimate demand right at the beginning; we’re long past that now even with the long lead time with chips,” Barra said. Demand for vehicles would be higher if the company had enough chips right now, she said. GM has been working deeper into the tiered supply chain as it seeks a longer-term solution to shortages, Barra said. As the semiconductor crunch persists, automakers are building closer ties with chip companies such as Intel Corp., Qualcomm Inc. and Nvidia Corp. to monitor supply. U.S. production of new vehicles this fall will continue to be constrained by the chip shortage and the spread of COVID-19 in Southeast Asia. On Sept. 16, IHS Markit slashed its vehicle production forecast for this year by 6.2%, or 5.02 million vehicles, the biggest decrease to the outlook since the chip shortage emerged. Want more news?

Vaccine Tracker & COVID-19 Flood Warning Is In Effect Dismiss Weather Alerts Alerts Bar GM plant gets fresh shipment of Microchips While the chips are down, GM has found a way to get production back up. At least for now. Published: Oct. 5, 2021 at 2:45 AM GMT+6 Share on FacebookEmail This LinkShare on TwitterShare on PinterestShare on LinkedIn CORRECTION: Satya Veerapaneni’s name was misspelled as ‘Satya Verapaneni’ in the original release of this article. It has been updated with that correction made. LANSING, Mich. (WILX) - General Motors dealers will start seeing Chevy Traverses and Buick Enclaves showing up on their lots again. That’s because the Delta Township plant has a new supply of microchips. GM officials told News 10 the thousands of cars that were waiting for chips are now being completed and being sent to dealerships. But, while the plant is back to work, it’s not back to where they were before the shortage. Satya Veerapaneni is the Executive Director for GM’s Delta Township Plant. “The supply condition is extremely dynamic, and the conditions are fluid. I think the whole industry is going to take time to stabilize,” Veerapaneni. GM staff say they always have to prepare for tomorrow, since nothing is guaranteed as the chip shortage plays out. Jeff Kosloski is a Shop Chairperson and a fourth-generation GM employee. He says he’s never seen a shortage like this before, but he has seen how seemingly small problems affect the automakers. “It’s never consistent, it’s cynical with the economy,” Kosloski said, “We’ve seen usually auto industry and trades work seems to be affected sooner when the economy’s not doing well.” Cars that once filled MSU parking lots waiting for chips are now being delivered to dealerships. Shaheen Chevrolet in Lansing confirmed it’s going to be getting some. GM did not specify which dealers are being prioritized, saying only that it’s trying to spread out its supply of chips where they’re most needed. Veerapaneni said, “We have a global purchasing team working with engineering, looking at the different product lines. Allocate the required chips to the facilities so we can bring one facility at a time, and based on that allocation we have received the chips we need to produce and ship our product.” GM isn’t saying how many microchips it has or where they came from. It will only say it doesn’t anticipate another shutdown. Experts believe the global chip shortage is going to last deep into next year. Copyright 2021 WILX. All rights reserved.

"Skip to main content Automotive News Automobilwoche Automotive News Canada Automotive News China October 04, 2021 07:05 AM Audi CEO sees chip shortage as 'perfect storm' Dealing with semiconductor supply crunch is 'day-to-day troubleshooting process,' Duesmann says Production of the Audi A3 is pictured in Ingolstadt, Germany. FRANKFURT -- Audi, Volkswagen Group's biggest profit contributor, has to troubleshoot on a day-to-day basis to tackle an ongoing shortage of auto chips, CEO Markus Duesmann said. ""We had a very strong first half in 2021. We do expect a much weaker second half. We really have trouble,"" Markus Duesmann told Reuters, calling the situation ""a perfect storm"". Duesmann's comments highlight the problems global automakers are facing in navigating a global chip supply crunch that has hit car production around the world. But while the car industry's vehicle sales have suffered it has softened the blow through price increases that have boosted margins. Audi in July said it had been unable to build a mid-five-digit number of cars in the first half of the year. But its profit margin in the period surged to 10.7 percent, even surpassing the 8 percent in 2019 before the pandemic struck. ""We are dealing with it pretty well I would say,"" said Duesmann, who also sits on the management board of VW Group. He said the group was seeking closer ties with chipmakers and that the automaker would emerge stronger from the crisis. ""But at the moment it's a day-to-day troubleshooting process,"" he said. Audi, which accounted for more than a quarter of VW's first-half operating profit, has embarked on an ambitious shift towards battery-powered vehicles, meaning all new models it will release from 2026 will be full electric. CONTENT FROM IHS MARKIT Automotive Research and Analysis Analysis and comments from the automotive team at IHS Markit on last week’s proposed greenhouse gas emission standards announced by the US EPA. Meantime, production of internal combustion engines will be gradually phased out up to 2033. EV transition could happen quickly, Duesmann says.   Audi's finance chief, Juergen Rittersberger, in August said it would only take 2-3 years before profitability of electric vehicles would match that of combustion engine cars. Duesmann thinks this could happen even more quickly. ""The point where we earn as much money with electric cars as with combustion engine cars is now, or ... next year, 2023. They are very even now, the prices,"" Duesmann said. Apart from efforts to challenge Tesla and become the biggest seller of EVs, VW is also doubling down on efforts to develop software, which CEO Herbert Diess said is the industry's real gamechanger. Duesmann, who took over as Audi CEO last year, has previously said that VW would make most of the automotive software needed for the group's transformation on its own and that it was too early to think about partnerships. ""Because at the moment ... it would take away speed, it would add complexity,"" Duesmann said. ""Certainly, we could share our software platform with other automotive companies but that is more mid-term, long-term ... 5-10 years."" Duesmann, a former BMW executive, now also has responsibility for luxury brands Lamborghini, Ducati and Bentley which have been brought under the Audi roof. The 52-year-old Ducati enthusiast brushed off recurring speculation that one of them could be sold, even though there was regular outside interest. ""These brands ... are very valuable very profitable brands, where we can even expand the synergy level in the future,"" Duesmann said. ""There are no plans whatsoever to get rid of them.""

""And when suddenly things are not getting to willing buyers from willing sellers, something seems off. You wonder where else the vulnerabilities are.” Today, On Point: What America's supply chain shortages means for your buying. Dr. Willy Shih, professor of management practice in business administration at Harvard Business School. (@WillyShih_atHBS) Will Douglas Heaven, senior editor at MIT Technology Review. Wyatt Olsen, CEO of Ultraviolet Audio Video in Santa Barbara, California. Transcript: 'The story of a computer chip' MEGHNA CHAKRABARTI: The semi-conductor chip. It's in your new phone, car, game console, kitchen appliances … or at least would be, if there weren’t a global shortage of these tiny tech wonders. CHAKRABARTI: To better understand why you can’t buy that new car or phone right now, it’s worth understanding how the chip comes into being in the first place, under the best of circumstances. CHAKRABARTI: And that story begins in the ground. With quartz, a mineral composed of silicon dioxide. WILL DOUGLAS HEAVEN: The silicon that comes out of the ground probably crisscrosses the world two or three times before it ends up in your phone. CHAKRABARTI: That’s Will Douglas Heaven. He’s a senior editor at MIT Technology Review. HEAVEN: So the cool thing that I think a lot of people don't know ... is that although computer chips are everywhere, I mean, there are few places in the world that you'll be far from a computer chip. But every single one of those chips is made from this material silicon. And there aren't actually that many places in the world where silicon is found in the ground pure enough to use to make computer chips. DOUGLAS HEAVEN: And there's one place in particular called Spruce Pine, that's a town in North Carolina. And there's a mine there where silica is found in sort of particularly pure quantities. That had been chopped away for ages, because what people were actually after for centuries was gemstones and this stuff called mica, which is used in paint. And it was only when the semiconductor industry took off in the 1980s that suddenly this quartz had new value and incredible value. CHAKRABARTI: Spruce Pine, North Carolina. Population, about 2,200. Humans have been mining here for more than 2,000 years, as evidenced by Native tribes who dug down 100 feet to pull mica from the ground millennia ago. The mica was later used in several of Thomas Edison’s inventions, also in paint, as you heard. And the quartz extracted from the mines now is the purest in the world. So as Robin Townsend of the local chamber of commerce says, “If you have a computer, you have a little slice of Spruce Pine.” Will Douglas Heaven describes how they get the quartz out of the ground. HEAVEN: And then these quartz rocks are dug up with machines and explosives, and then they're put into a crusher which crunches these rocks up into gravel. That gravel then goes to a processing plant where the quartz gravel is ground down further into a fine sand. CHAKRABARTI: The sand is processed to separate out and refine the silicon. HEAVEN: And it's been bagged up and and sent off to the next stage. CHAKRABARTI: That next stage is where the pure elemental silicon starts looking like something more familiar. And there are only a few facilities around the world where this happens – such as SUMCO in Japan. Or Siltronic AG in Germany. HEAVEN: The powder is melted down into cylinders. So you imagine a sort of a salami. And then we're getting close to what people would recognize as chips. This sort of ... cylinder is then finally sliced into wafers like you're chopping a cucumber or a salami. So you end up with these round thin disks. CHAKRABARTI: And then, they’re shipped off again, to a factory that makes the actual chips. This could be in Austin, Texas. Incheon, South Korea. Hsinchu, Taiwan. Or even Hillsboro, Oregon. HEAVEN: Once you get up to making chips themselves, which get printed onto this thin disk. This is extremely delicate, the conditions need to be sort of like lab conditions. You see pictures of workers in these chip factories wearing what looked like hazmat suits. You just can't have any kind of contamination. No dust, anything like that, because that will completely wreck the the mine circuitry on the chips that you’re trying to print on. And so any kind of little bit of dust that got into that would completely ruin it. Which is kind of cool. We've gone from the messy quarry with the dust and explosions, all the way now to sort of super, super clean labs, which is where the chips get made. CHAKRABARTI: And as the chips get made, new materials are printed onto the wafers. These materials have their own complex supply chains as well. Things like copper, which might come from Chile. Or aluminum, which might come from China. Or boron, which might come from Turkey. CHAKRABARTI: Then, the wafer is sent to yet another factory for testing, where microscopic probes assess whether the chip is working as required. They’re cut apart and put into packages — adding even more materials to the process. CHAKRABARTI: And then they’re shipped off again ... to other factories where they are finally put them on circuit boards. And those factories are usually not in the same places as where the chip makes its final stop: assembly into cars, computers, phones and appliances.

General Motors secures supply for silicon carbide chips for its next-gen EVs Posted on October 5, 2021 General Motors (GM) announced an agreement with semiconductor company Wolfspeed Inc., securing its chip supply for the company’s future electric vehicle lineup. Wolfspeed will develop and provide silicon carbide (SiC) power solutions for GM’s electric vehicles. GM plans to use Wolfspeed chips in its new Ultium Drive units, which will power the OEM’s electric vehicle lineup. Tesla and Chinese EV manufacturer NIO use SiC chips in their vehicles. Tesla became one of the most notable automakers to use SiC chips for mass-produced vehicles by incorporating it into the Model 3. (Mohawk Valley Fab Render SiC power solutions feature several benefits. They cut energy loss by more than half compared to traditional silicon wafers, and they also dissipate heat well. Silicon carbide is also the world’s third-hardest substance. Wolfspeed is based in North Carolina and produces Silicon Carbide (SiC) chips. As per its agreement with GM, Wolfspeed plans to produce “silicon carbide power device solutions” at its 200mm-capable Mohawk Valley Fab in Marcy, New York. Last fall, the company announced its plans to establish a Silicon Carbide corridor along the East Coast of the United States. Wolfspeed is still constructing Mohawk Valley Fab, which it claims will be the world’s largest Silicon Carbide fabrication facility that would be “automotive-qualified” and 200mm-capable. The Mohawk Valley Fab facility is expected to go online in early 2022. “Our agreement with Wolfspeed represents another step forward in our transition to an all-electric future,” said Shilpan Amin, GM vice president, Global Purchasing and Supply Chain. “Customers of EVs are looking for greater range, and we see silicon carbide as an essential material in the design of our power electronics to meet customer demand. Working with Wolfspeed will help ensure we can deliver on our vision of an all-electric future.” GM will also participate in the Wolfspeed Assurance of Supply Program (WS AoSP). As part of the Ws AoSP, GM secures its silicon carbide chip supply for future EV production. GM recently reported a decrease in third-quarter sales, citing the semiconductor shortage as the cause. ARK Invest Cathie Wood pointed out that EVs require more chips per vehicle, so GM securing its chips supply with Wolfspeed might be a step in the right direction.

PUBLISHED 3 WEEKS AGO. ABOUT A 4 MINUTE READ. As the global chip shortage drags on and demand for electronics exceeds supply, we hope that the market for refurbished electronic devices and a circular economy will gain more traction. By now you have likely heard of the global microchip shortage or been impacted by it somehow. Chances are anything you bought online in the past year, especially if it was an electronic device, cost more and took longer to deliver. That is because microchips (aka semiconductors) are necessary at so many points along the electronics supply chain. Much of the focus has been on the fact that the manufacturing stage of our personal electronic devices is chip intensive; but the logistical side needs to be considered, as well: Cars, boats, planes, trains, delivery trucks — all motorized vehicles rely on microchips to get your order to you. It really makes you think differently when you go to buy a new laptop or phone. Supply and demand issues happen all the time across all industries; but this one specifically has impacted everyday consumers profoundly. As demand for chips is only predicted to increase in the coming years, one growing sector is poised to help keep the floor from falling out of the technology sector. This is, of course, refurbished electronics. The growth of this sector would alleviate some of the supply pressure put on manufacturers, whilst meeting consumers’ demand for electronics from smartphones to appliances. And this would also help push the price of electronics down by keeping more of them in circulation longer. Technology companies prioritize selling the latest and greatest, and unsurprisingly have not been overwhelmingly supportive of the repair market. However, with the COVID-fueled global chip shortage, the industry’s ability to continue churning out shiny new devices took a hit in the past year — and consumer demand now outpaces supply in a number of industries. But, contrary to what it may seem, the chip shortage is not all doom and gloom. Embracing a circular economy Supply chain issues will help push us towards more sustainable tech options, thus providing consumers with better value and the planet with better options. Refurbished electronics are more readily available and offer nearly the same ""must-have"" features, all at a much more affordable price. THE 2020S: THE DECADE OF REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE? Join us as PepsiCo, Timberland and more discuss their efforts to optimize and future-proof their agricultural supply chains through regenerative practices — October 19 at SB'21 San Diego. Big tech companies’ business model centers on new product sales every year, which takes a toll on the environment. Only 20 percent of electronics sold are properly recycled, and the rest end up in landfills. This makes e-waste the fastest-growing form of waste in the world. Most big tech companies have vowed to become carbon neutral by 2030; if they want to achieve that goal, they will have to start embracing a circular business model — as major players including Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, HP and more are slowly beginning to do. That’s where refurbished electronics come in. The industry has seen huge strides in recent years in terms of quality and customer protection. Customers now have a wealth of options to choose from to get good-as-new tech for less. Of course, more options can mean more homework for consumers. That’s why we are seeing marketplace models such as Back Market grow. Marketplaces do the legwork — they often set quality standards among providers, provide guarantees and minimize risks, and make the proposition of buying refurbished electronics a lot less risky. Refurbished providers are addressing a rapidly growing environmental issue by giving consumers a choice. Most if not all of the major cell service providers offer 2-year contracts and other deals that make it enticing for customers to upgrade to the newest device; sometimes they can upgrade for free just by signing on. This may seem like the norm in the US; but the truth is, this model is inherently unsustainable due to the massive amount of e-waste it produces. With good-as-new, refurbished options offered by companies such as Back Market, breaking away from the linear model that has served big tech for decades can be achieved. This is also relevant at a corporate level, as it gives environmentally conscious brands the option to supply their workforce with devices that have a much lower carbon footprint. As chip supply catches up to demand, we hope that the refurbished market and a circular economy can gain more traction. Interestingly, 50 percent of customers in the US that bought from Back Market in the past year were trying refurbished for the first time. This points to how young the circular economy is — and how much it can grow with a little help from, well, everyone. You can make sure your devices do not end up in a landfill; there are plenty of options to keep your old device in circulation. The demand for devices is not expected to decrease, therefore shortages in electronics will likely persist. If you are in the market for an electronic device, buying used is certainly a smart option — not only for your wallet, but more importantly for the environment.

Other chip industry executives, such as AMD CEO Lisa Su, have signaled that additional manufacturing capacity will begin addressing those issues next year. The shortage has harmed several sectors, but perhaps no more than the automotive industry where production has been slowed due to a lack of chips, leading to drops in sales. Narumon Bowonkitwanchai | Moment | Getty Images The semiconductor chip shortage that is hamstringing the production of products ranging from cars and computers to appliances and toothbrushes will extend into 2022 and potentially beyond that, the CEO of semiconductor company Marvell Technology said. “Right now, every single end market for semiconductors is up simultaneously; I’ve been in this industry 27 years, I’ve never seen that happen,” said Marvell CEO Matt Murphy during a CNBC Technology Executive Council event on Thursday. “If it stays business as usual, and everything’s up and to the right, this is going to be a very painful period, including in 2022 for the duration of the year.” While several chip producers have announced plans to expand factory capacity, Murphy, who noted his firm is fabless and works with contract manufacturers on its designs, said “that’s not going to kick in until 2023 and 2024 — so there’s this painful period.” That is a more pessimistic view than some of Murphy’s chip industry peers, who have recently said they expect the shortage to wane next year as new factories open. “We’ve always gone through cycles of ups and downs, where demand has exceeded supply or vice versa,” AMD CEO Lisa Su said Monday at the Code Conference in Beverly Hills, California. “This time, it’s different.” Su said that while she expects the first half of 2022 to be “likely tight,” the second half will be less severe as manufacturing capacity opens. “It might take, you know, 18 to 24 months to put on a new plant, and in some cases even longer than that,” Su said. “These investments were started perhaps a year ago.” AMD rival Intel is one of the companies that has looked to double down on manufacturing, announcing in March that it would invest $20 billion in two new chip factories in Arizona. TSMC, which is the biggest manufacturer of semiconductors on contract and works with companies including Marvell, is also building a $12 billion factory in Arizona. The company announced in April that it would invest $100 billion over the next three years to increase factory capacity. No one knows for sure when ‘painful period’ of chip shortages will end: Marvell Technology CEO “Massive pockets of inventory” Murphy said the shortage may be addressed as the demand for certain chip-using products finally falls. “I think there’s no way, from my point of view, that every segment of the electronics industry stays up and to the right, ripping demand for another 12 months; it doesn’t make any sense,” Murphy said. “I think something’s got to give. And when it gives that should free up the capacity in aggregate for the rest of the industry to go consume and ultimately align it with the true demand.” Slowing of demand could come from areas such as the personal computer market, Murphy said, citing Micron Technology’s lower-than-expected sales guidance for its upcoming quarter. Micron Technology CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said on CNBC’s “Mad Money” on Wednesday that while PC end user demand is strong, “some of the PC customers are not able to fulfill their demand because they’re not getting sufficient all components that are needed to build the PCs.” More than 300 million personal computers were sold in 2020, according to market intelligence firm IDC, up from 268 million in 2019. That led some analysts to project upwards of 400 million PC sales in the coming years, but it is a sales trajectory which Murphy expressed doubts about during the CNBC TEC event. Eventually, Murphy said he expects there to be “massive pockets of over inventory when this is all done.” “If you look at how many masks or hand sanitizers or toilet paper that is flowing around, there was a panic, and there’s a panic buy on semiconductors right now,” he said. “At some point, you order an order and it goes the other way.” Auto industry still being hit hard Any chip inventory relief would be welcomed by the automotive industry, which has perhaps been the hardest hit by the lack of semiconductors. General Motors said Friday that U.S. vehicle sales during the third quarter fell by more than 30% year-over-year as the chip shortage interrupted production and reduced available inventory at dealerships. Last month, the automaker shut down production at most of its North American plants again as it dealt with a lack of semiconductor chips. That short supply has forced General Motors to shift its available chips to only its most popular and profitable vehicles, such as pickup trucks. Overall, U.S. auto sales are expected to drop at least 13% in the third quarter due to disrupted production tied back to the chip shortage, according to industry estimates. Still, several automakers suggested those issues could be absolved soon. “The semiconductor supply disruptions that impacted our third-quarter wholesale and customer deliveries are improving,” Steve Carlisle, GM president of North America, said in a statement. “As we look to the fourth quarter, a steady flow of vehicles held at plants will continue to be released to dealers, we are restarting production at key crossover and car plants, and we look forward to a more stable operating environment through the fall.” Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently called the semiconductor chip shortage a “short-term” problem, saying that “there’s a lot of chip fabrication plants that are being built and I think we will have good capacity by next year.” Refocusing the supply chain Murphy said the shortage of semiconductors has shifted some of the thinking as it relates to the supply chain. “Even before the pandemic hit there was tightening that was going on,” he said. “The chip companies actually have to take a different view now of supply entry, it’s a strategic imperative in terms of how you plan your capacity, your relationships with your suppliers.” There is more willingness from buyers to pay for capacity in advance or to sign up for take-or-pay agreements, which would mean the company would take the product from the supplier or pay a penalty, Murphy said. “We’re viewing this as a strategic shift to capacity being strategic, not just an afterthought,” he said.

Reading Time: 2 minutes Global chip shortage pushes Rivian to take action Electric vehicle truck startup Rivian Automotive is planning on building its own battery cells, according to its U.S. initial public offering filed last week.    An employee performs a quality inspection on the General Assembly line at Rivian’s manufacturing plant in Normal, IL. Photo Courtesy Rivian Automative Rivian, which currently gets the batteries it uses for its R1T pickups and R1S SUVs from South Korean company Samsung SDI, is making the move partly in response to a global chip shortage that has negatively impacted the auto industry.   “We depend upon third parties to manufacture and to supply key semiconductor chip components necessary for our vehicles,” said Rivian. “If these manufacturers or suppliers become unwilling or unable to provide an adequate supply of semiconductor chips, with respect to which there is a global shortage, we may not be able to find alternative sources in a timely manner and our business would be adversely impacted.”  The EV truck startup, which Reuters reports has powerful backers in Amazon and Ford, said manufacturing its own battery cells will “complement third-party cell procurement which will provide supply continuity and support our anticipated growth.”    Rivian has disclosed losses of almost $1 billion during the first half of this year and says it expects capital expenditure to come out to around $8 billion by the end of 2023 for investments in battery cell production, manufacturing capacity, and charging networks, among other things.   “Given the paramount importance and impact of the battery system on vehicle range, performance, and price, we have built in-house capabilities across the entire value chain,” Rivian said. “Over time, we intend to expand our capabilities related to proprietary cell development and in-house cell manufacturing and expect that these functions will grow substantially in the coming years.”  The company also plans to invest $5 billion into building a second assembly plant in the U.S. that will also contribute to battery cell production.   Electric vehicle giant Tesla also announced plans to manufacture its own battery cells last year, reports Reuters, however the company canceled a planned release of its Model S Plaid+ Sedan powered by the battery cells earlier this year.

The decline was slightly wider than industry analysts’ expectations of 28.9% and 31.5%. GM continues to maintain its financial guidance for the year, including adjusted earnings between $11.5 billion and $13.5 billion, or $5.40 to $6.40 a share. An American flag flies at a Chevrolet dealership on August 4, 2021 in Glendale, California. In spite of a computer chip shortage, General Motors (GM) posted a $2.8 billion net profit in the second quarter. Mario Tama | Getty Images DETROIT – General Motors’ U.S. vehicle sales during the third quarter plummeted by more than 30% from last year as an ongoing shortage of semiconductor chips interrupted vehicle production and cut dealer inventories. The Detroit automaker on Friday said it sold about 447,000 vehicles from July through September, down 32.8% from a year earlier when sales volumes were depressed due to the coronavirus pandemic. The decline was slightly wider than industry analysts’ expectations of 28.9% and 31.5%. The chip shortage has caused GM to shutter plants for weeks, if not months, and also partially produce vehicles that are in high demand such as its full-size pickup trucks to then finish when chips become available. GM’s big bet on electric vehicles GM warned investors last month its North American wholesale volumes would be down about 200,000 units in the second half of 2021 compared with the first six months of the year. It continues to maintain its financial guidance for the year, including adjusted earnings between $11.5 billion and $13.5 billion, or $5.40 to $6.40 a share. Every brand for the automaker reported double-digit sales losses in the third quarter, led by a 36.1% decline for Chevrolet. GM plans to make up some lost volume in the fourth quarter, as Steve Carlisle, GM president of North America, on Friday said the chip supply constraint is improving. “The semiconductor supply disruptions that impacted our third-quarter wholesale and customer deliveries are improving,” he said in a statement. “As we look to the fourth quarter, a steady flow of vehicles held at plants will continue to be released to dealers, we are restarting production at key crossover and car plants, and we look forward to a more stable operating environment through the fall.” GM reported its overall sales through September were level with a year ago at about 1.8 million units. Sales for the company’s brands are all up for the year side from Chevrolet, which is down by 5.6% Buick increased by 27.4%, GMC by 8% and Cadillac by 10.8%, according to GM. GM was among the first major automakers to report third-quarter sales on Friday. Overall, analysts estimate automakers sold less than 3.4 million vehicles, down between 13% and 14% from the same time last year. Business Roundtable appoints GM CEO Mary Barra its next chair South Korean automakers Kia and Hyundai, which have the same parent company but operate separately in the U.S., were expected to be outliers in the third quarter. Combined, sales for Hyundai-Kia increased 9.1% from a year earlier. The sales beat overall industry expectations but were slightly lower than some analysts forecasted. Hyundai reported a 10.9% increase, including its luxury Genesis brand, and Kia’s sales were up 7.3%. Asia-based automakers, including Hyundai and Kia, have fared better through the semiconductor chip shortage than U.S. companies. Others automakers to report September and/or third-quarter sales include: Toyota Motor said its third-quarter sales increased 1.4% from the same time last year to 566,005 vehicles, despite a 22.4% decrease in September. Stellantis (formerly Fiat Chrysler) sold 410,917 vehicles during the third quarter, down about 19%. Honda Motor reported sales of 345,914 in the third quarter, down by 10.9% Porsche said it sold 15,289 vehicles during the third quarter, down 1.7% compared with a year earlier. Nissan Motor sold 198,955 vehicles during the third quarter, down 10%.

"SPOTLIGHT STORY INSIDE A U.S. ARMY BASE HOUSING AFGHAN REFUGEES Red Border: Branded Content by TIME Shop the TIME Store Your California Privacy Rights Inside the Taiwan Firm That Makes the World’s Tech Run A worker enters a “clean room” at chipmaker TSMC’s headquarters in Hsinchu, Taiwan, on Sept. 10 Billy H.C. Kwok for TIME OCTOBER 1, 2021 6:30 AM EDT n the northwest coast of Taiwan, nestled between mudflats teeming with fiddler crabs and sweet-scented persimmon orchards, sits the world’s most important company that you’ve probably never heard of. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., or TSMC, is the world’s largest contract manufacturer of the semiconductor chips—otherwise known as integrated circuits, or just chips—that power our phones, laptops, cars, watches, refrigerators and more. Its clients include Apple, Intel, Qualcomm, AMD and Nvidia. Inside its boxy off-white headquarters in sleepy Hsinchu County, technicians in brightly hued protective suits—white and blue for employees, green for contractors and pink for pregnant women—push polished metal carts under a sallow protective light. Above their heads, “claw machines”—nicknamed after the classic arcade game—haul 9-kg plastic containers containing 25 individual slices, or “wafers,” of silicon on rails among hundreds of manufacturing stations, where they are extracted one by one for processing, much like a jukebox selecting a record. Only after six to eight weeks of painstaking etching and testing can each wafer be carved up into individual chips to be dispatched around the planet. “We always say that it’s like building a high-rise,” one TSMC section manager tells TIME, pointing to how his technicians diligently follow instructions dictated to them via tablet. “You can only build one story at a time.” The $550 billion firm today controls more than half the global market for made-to-order chips and has an even tighter stranglehold on the most advanced processors, with more than 90% of market share by some estimates. Combating cell stress: The human health breakthrough you’ve never heard of TSMC workers in the “clean room” where fabrication of chips takes place in the company’s Hsinchu headquarters Billy H.C. Kwok for TIME “TSMC is just absolutely critical,” says Peter Hanbury, a semiconductor specialist at the Bain & Co. consulting firm. “They basically control the most complicated part of the semiconductor ecosystem, and they’re a near monopoly at the bleeding edge.” The importance of semiconductor chips has grown exponentially over the past half century. In 1969, the Apollo lunar module sent tens of thousands of transistors with a combined weight of 70 lb. to the moon; today, an Apple MacBook crams 16 billion transistors within its total weight of just 3 lb. The prevalence of chips will keep rising alongside the spread of mobile devices, the Internet of things (IOT), 5G and 6G networks and a growth in demand for computing power. Global chip sales were $440 billion in 2020 and are projected to grow over 5% annually. President Joe Biden calls them “critical products” whose “supply-chain disruptions can put Americans’ lives and livelihoods at risk,” while the governments of Japan and South Korea compare the importance of semiconductors to “rice.” TSMC’s success in cornering this vital market has become a geostrategic migraine. The Pentagon is pressing the Biden Administration to invest more in advanced chipmaking, so its missiles and fighter jets are not dependent on a self-ruling island that China’s strongman President Xi Jinping believes is a breakaway province and has repeatedly threatened to invade. More immediately, a global chip shortage has impacted a staggering 169 industries, according to Goldman Sachs analysis, from steel and ready-mix concrete to air-conditioning units and breweries. Most drastically, automakers across America, Japan and Europe were forced to slow and even halt production, meaning 3.9 million fewer cars will roll into world showrooms this year than last. Car companies “immediately pointed the finger at TSMC” for the shortage, TSMC chairman Mark Liu tells TIME in an exclusive interview. “But I told them, ‘You are my customer’s customer’s customer. How could I [prioritize others] and not give you chips?’” The scarcity of chips has thrust TSMC from a largely anonymous services company to the center of a global tussle over the future of technology; the firm will play an outsize role in determining what the world looks like at the end of this decade. Some foresee an emerging dystopia, driven by a worsening climate crisis and rising geopolitical tensions between China and the U.S. Liu’s more optimistic scenario is that widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) by 2030 will help mitigate the ravages of climate change through granular weather prediction, make more accurate cancer diagnoses possible earlier, and even fight fake news through automated fact-checking of social media. “With COVID-19, everybody feels the future has been sped up,” says Liu. From his perspective, what it will look like “is much clearer than, say, two years ago.” The semiconductor-chip shortage first got boardrooms sweating around February, when average order-to-delivery times for chips stretched to an unprecedented 15 weeks because of a confluence of factors: a pandemic-induced economic slump prompted carmakers to prematurely slash chip orders, which soon rebounded as chips were hoarded by firms that feared being embroiled in the U.S.-China trade and technology war. Amid what was described as a global chip shortage, more chips were being sent to factories than were leaving them in products, meaning “there are people definitely accumulating chips who-knows-where in the supply chain,” says Liu. A silicon wafer on display before being sliced into chips Billy H.C. Kwok for TIME TSMC chairman Mark Liu Billy H.C. Kwok for TIME To fix things, Liu ordered his team to triangulate different data points to decipher which customers were truly in need and which were stockpiling. “We are learning too, because we didn’t have to do this before,” says Liu. It forced him into tough decisions to delay orders for valued clients whose immediate need was judged to be less acute. “Sometimes [customers] may not be satisfied, but we just have to do what’s best for the industry.” The crisis sharpened focus on access to technology that the U.S. invented and still designs better than anyone else but doesn’t manufacture at scale anymore. Biden’s $2 trillion plan to fix American infrastructure included $50 billion to boost semiconductor competitiveness. That was on top of $52 billion committed under the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act, which was passed by the Senate in June and is aimed squarely at competing with China in all areas of technology. Yet TSMC alone is investing $100 billion in new capacity over the next three years. It’s a staggering sum, though for Liu, “the more I look at it, it’s not going to be enough.” The semiconductor industry has contracted even as the chips themselves have grown more prevalent and pivotal. Other than TSMC, the only firm capable of commercially producing today’s most advanced 5-nanometer (nm) chips is South Korea’s Samsung Electronics. However, TSMC is building a new fabrication plant—or “fab”—across 22 football fields of land in southern Taiwan to produce groundbreaking 3-nm chips, expected to be up to 15% faster and use far less power. This latest generation of chip manufacture, or “node,” will leave U.S. firms like Intel and GlobalFoundries at least two generations behind. “That’s disgraceful for Intel,” says Daniel Nenni, co-author of Fabless: The Transformation of the Semiconductor Industry. “It’s just very disappointing that they lost leadership.” Read More: From Cars to Toasters, America’s Semiconductor Shortage Is Wreaking Havoc on Our Lives. Can We Fix It? At the outset of the modern computing industry, pioneers like Intel designed and built chips in-house. But American firms began to struggle against Japanese competitors in the 1980s and, to remain competitive, outsourced the fabricating sides of their businesses, instead concentrating on the more profitable design aspect. Fabs were expensive, with low margins, so offsetting that capital investment and risk made a lot of sense. The “fabless” trend was foreseen by a canny Chinese-born engineer named Morris Chang, who founded TSMC in 1987 after studying at Harvard, Stanford and MIT and working for 25 years at Texas Instruments. Among his many breakthroughs, Chang pioneered the tactic of initially pricing chips at a loss, in the expectation that gaining an early market share would increase scale to the point when reduced costs would generate a profit. As the technology advanced, the cost of new fabs soared, pushing more chipmakers to outsource and TSMC’s market share to increase. “It was doing work that nobody else wanted to do,” says Willy Shih, a professor at Harvard Business School. Workers and visitors must don dust-proof clothing before entering the clean room Billy H.C. Kwok for TIME In June 2018, at the age of 86, Chang finally handed over the reins of TSMC to Liu and CEO C.C. Wei. What might have been a difficult transition instead proved a springboard for a more aggressive business philosophy that enabled TSMC to pull clear of rivals. Apart from the billions invested in locking down technological primacy, it is embarking on “a geographic diversification that would not have happened under Morris Chang,” says Shih. While Wei was the more technically focused of the new leadership team, he was perfectly complemented by the polished and business-oriented Liu, whose idea of fun is kicking back with a global-affairs periodical and a classical-music stream on YouTube. In many ways, Liu’s career path traces that of his mentor, Chang. A native of Taipei, Liu earned his Ph.D. at the University of California, Berkeley, before taking a job at Intel, where he helped launch the transformative i386 processor that fueled the personal-computer revolution of the late 1980s. After leaving Intel, he spent six years conducting research at AT&T Bell Laboratories in New Jersey before joining TSMC in 1993. One of his first roles was to get his “hands wet” in fab construction, he says, as the founder took him under his wing. “Morris gave me a huge trail of experience, from operations to planning, sales, marketing and R&D,” says Liu. “That’s why I ask our people to get out of their comfort zone to learn things and not just feel satisfied getting a good performance review from your boss.” TSMC’s more recent run of success has been linked to one client in particular: Apple. The Cupertino behemoth outsourced the manufacturing of its chips to Samsung for the first six generations of iPhones. But after Samsung launched its own competing Galaxy smartphones, Apple in 2011 brought a lawsuit over IP theft, which was ultimately settled with an award of $539 million to the American firm. That dispute was a boon to TSMC as Apple sought to extricate its supply chains from Samsung and avoid any partnerships that could burnish a potential rival. It was reassuring that TSMC was a dedicated foundry business that wouldn’t stray from its lane. Apple remains TSMC’s biggest client today. “It is a trust business,” says Liu. “We do not compete with our customers.” Apple was also pivotal to TSMC’s emergence as undisputed technology leader. Computing has been long governed by Moore’s Law, named after Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, which is better described as an “observation” that processing power doubles every two or so years. The tendency of the industry was to prioritize a new semiconductor node to fit that time frame. However, Apple insisted that it wanted a new node for each iteration of iPhone. Because Apple prides itself on never missing a launch of its crown jewel, TSMC was under enormous pressure to come up with constant advances. So instead of combining lots of new technologies to double power every two years, it pioneered small advances annually. “People made fun of TSMC, saying, ‘Oh, that’s not a real node,’” says Nenni. “But taking these baby steps helped them learn these new technologies. And they laughed all the way to the bank.” Still, leadership brings different challenges. Chips may be ubiquitous today, but uses for the most advanced variety remain limited. (Toasters and traffic lights can use far less advanced nodes.) As TSMC’s pool of customers has shrunk, the risk of one of them being caught up in political turbulence has swelled; TSMC last year stopped supplying Chinese telecom giant Huawei, for example, after U.S. intelligence agencies accused it—without presenting hard evidence—of being a proxy for the Chinese state. Finding the required resources to keep pushing boundaries is also becoming tougher on an island of just 23 million, where a recent severe drought put the water-intensive semiconductor industry in jeopardy. “The future is more and more challenging,” says Dan Wang, an industry and technology analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics. “When you’re at the top, the only direction is down.” Read more: Inside the Controversial Company Helping China Control the Future of the Internet TSMC’s dominance is such that its chief rivals are not companies but governments. The auto-industry shortage was a wake-up call for policymakers already reeling from the pandemic and trade war. The European Commission has unveiled a public-private semiconductor alliance aimed at increasing its share of global production to 20% by 2030. South Korea’s government is offering incentives to drive a $450 billion investment by chipmakers through 2030. Wafer before being sliced into chips Billy H.C. Kwok for TIME China, meanwhile, has been throwing billions at the semiconductor problem, with limited success and some eye-catching failures. Although it will likely soon become the biggest producer of chips by volume, they are not of the latest design. Its top firm is Shanghai-based SMIC, but despite $300 million in government grants in 2019, the best chip it can produce is about five years behind TSMC’s, with little hope of catching up. Meanwhile, at least six multibillion-dollar Chinese chip firms have gone bust over the past two years, including Wuhan Hongxin Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which turned out to be a $20 billion scam perpetrated by tricksters with no industry experience. Beijing’s efforts to catch up have also been hampered by Washington’s repeatedly blocking its attempts to buy foreign chip firms outright, as well as the specialized equipment needed for cutting-edge fabs. This presents a quandary for Beijing, which aspires to the enhanced geopolitical clout that global technological leadership brings. Xi has regularly highlighted the critical importance of “indigenous R&D,” creating “secure and controllable supply chains” and achieving breakthroughs on “choke-point technologies.” The situation also presents a quandary to Taiwan and the U.S. While American firms account for 65% of all TSMC sales, China is the biggest end destination by virtue of its role as the world’s factory, importing around $350 billion worth of chips in 2020 alone. Boston Consulting Group estimates that “decoupling” the U.S. and Chinese tech sectors would trim U.S. chip-company revenues by $80 billion, while competition with Beijing would cost those same firms $10 billion to $15 billion. Liu echoes many business executives when he says that the current enmity between the U.S. and China benefits no one. Many Chinese firms are stockpiling chips lest they find themselves targeted as Huawei has been. “The U.S. and China need to understand that they may not be friends, but they are not enemies either,” says Liu. “We need common rules to … give people some expectation about how to do business.” If TSMC is caught in the middle of a tug-of-war between Washington and Beijing, then so too is the island on which it sits—with far more dangerous potential consequences. On Sept. 16, senior U.S. and Australian officials vowed to “strengthen ties” with Taiwan just a day after both nations, with the U.K., unveiled a new security alliance, dubbed AUKUS, to contain China. Beijing is already sending air and naval sorties close to Taiwan territory with alarming frequency. Strategists say Taiwan is protected by an effective “silicon shield,” given what the disruption to chip supply chains in the event of an invasion would mean for China’s economy. However, as tensions and the importance of chips rise in tandem, some analysts are reassessing this viewpoint. Oriana Skylar Mastro, a specialist on China’s military at Stanford University’s Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, says the prospect of gaining effective control of the world’s chip supply may make Taiwan more, not less, vulnerable, because a prize that big means Beijing could effectively dictate peace terms: “I think it gives China an upper hand.” Liu disagrees, insisting the threat of invasion by Beijing is “overblown.” “Taiwan definitely would not create actions to trigger a war,” he says, acknowledging that the cross-strait relationship is no longer dictated solely by the island. “It is really the U.S.-China relationship.” Despite America’s dominance of chip design, its lack of manufacturing capability remains worrisome for policymakers, who are trying to bring more fabs onshore. While remaining a TSMC customer, Intel is revamping its foundry business, building two new fabs in Arizona at a cost of $20 billion. Last year, TSMC committed to building a $12 billion fab, also in the Grand Canyon State. It is also exploring more plants in mainland China, Japan and Europe. Liu is candid about the reasons for that U.S. investment and its limitations. It was prompted by “political nudges on our customers,” he says, insisting that “semiconductor localization will not increase supply-chain resilience.” He says it may even “degrade resilience.” Read More: Why Is Everything More Expensive Right Now? Let This Stuffed Giraffe Explain Making chips is so unbelievably complex and specialized that diversifying the location of fabs will make it more difficult to maintain quality. The transistor in a 3-nm node is just 1/20,000th the width of a human hair. Were you to enlarge a foot-long wafer of semiconductor to the size of the continental U.S., the required patterning for these chips would still be only the width of a thumbnail. The key component may only be silicon—or purified sand—but the magic happens in how it is processed and manipulated. “It’s like baking bread,” says the TSMC section manager. “The ingredients are pretty much the same, but how long should you bake it, what temperature should it be, that’s what matters.” A FOUP (Front Opening Unified Pod) waiting to be picked up from the stocker Billy H.C. Kwok for TIME For this reason, TSMC’s foundry is meticulously controlled. All visitors must don head covers, dust-free jackets, pants and shoes before passing through an “air shower” to remove errant particles. The extreme ultraviolet lithography machines that TSMC uses each cost around $175 million. Larger fabs will have 20 of them. Creating a chip takes around 1,500 steps, each with 100 to 500 variables. Even if each step’s success rate is 99.9%, that means less than a quarter of the final output is usable. “Is there something slightly different in the water or the air or the chemicals in Arizona?” asks Hanbury. “The R&D team is not going to be a bullet train away to solve these problems.” While TSMC founder Chang praised “cheap land and electricity” in the U.S. in a recent speech, he also grumbled that “we had to try hard to scout out competent technicians and workers.” Liu notes that costs in the U.S. have turned out to be “much higher” than TSMC expected. It all points to a localization craze driven by politics rather than by science or business. After all, opening a fab in the U.S. affects only one small part of the manufacturing process. Today, semiconductors are typically designed in the U.S., fabricated in Taiwan or South Korea, tested and assembled in Southeast Asia, and then installed into products in China. It is already incredibly specialized: as much as TSMC dominates foundry services, only the Dutch firm ASML produces those advanced lithography machines that all its fabs rely on. If a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, opening fabs in the U.S. won’t strengthen much. U.S. competitiveness may be boosted only incrementally. The new TSMC plant in Arizona, for one, will produce 5-nm chips, which, though cutting edge today, will be a couple of nodes behind the fastest when mass production begins in 2024. Meanwhile, TSMC’s headquarters will be moving ahead with next-generation 3-D integrated circuits, which, Liu says, “will unleash the innovation of semiconductor architectures.” These technologies are so advanced that it’s impossible to catch up without pumping in vast sums of money. Even then, nothing is guaranteed. After all, the $100 billion investment that TSMC unveiled does not stand alone. It is combined with and augmented by the deep R&D pockets of Apple, Nvidia and all TSMC’s other close partners to create a “budget that is 100 times what you will see on their financials,” says Nenni. “It’s just impossible for any company or country to catch up to this huge ecosystem that’s moving forward like a freight train.” What would make more sense, says Liu, is for the U.S. to ensure it stands at the frontier of the next great advance. Its lifesaving prowess in mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, for example, exists only because of huge investments in genomics and biotechnology over the past 40 years. Instead of futilely chasing and localizing aspects of the semiconductor supply chain, Liu suggests plowing that same money into developing the next great leap. “The U.S. should focus on their strengths: system design, AI, quantum computing, those forward-looking things,” says Liu. TSMC may already have won 2030, but the decade after is still up for grabs. —With reporting by Gladys Tsai/Hsinchu and Alejandro de la Garza/New York MORE MUST-READ STORIES FROM TIME Fixing Facebook's Algorithm Could Help Teens—and Democracy New York's Vaccine Mandate Is Working, But Hospitals Are Struggling With the Fallout Inside a Wisconsin Army Base Where Nearly 13,000 Afghans Await an Uncertain Future Atlanta’s First Black Female District Attorney Is at the Center of America's Converging Crises How Seinfeld Became One of TV's Great Moneymakers Men Are Now More Likely to Be Single Than Women.

The Shiba Inu cryptocurrency is now the world’s 20th-biggest after surging 216% over the past week See how to transform your operations with data Is this the sound of a stock market bubble popping? ‘It’s going to be less than that.’ Biden cuts $3.5 trillion signature bill to save support from moderates Shares of this obscure chip component supplier have surged by over 1200% in the past three years September 16, 2021 10:37 AM GMT+6 Subscribe to Data Sheet, a daily brief on the business of tech, delivered free to your inbox. Nan Ya Printed Circuit Board Corp. is hardly a household name in the tech industry. But the obscure Taiwanese company makes an essential component for chipmaking that has become the latest bottleneck for automakers and electronics companies suffering from semiconductor shortages. The connected future of audio The component goes by the unwieldy name of Ajinomoto build-up film (ABF) substrate and it’s one of the least glamorous niches in the chips industry. It’s part of the packaging that protects the handful of chips needed to power your computer or car and allows communication among them. Many of the world’s most advanced semiconductors can’t run without the substrates. So while giants like Intel Corp. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. spend hundreds of billions trying to alleviate chip shortages, the lack of that single component could hinder production for years. Supplies are likely to remain constrained until at least 2025 due to limited capacity, according to people familiar with the matter.  Top executives from Intel, Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. have all warned about shortages in recent months. Broadcom Corp. recently told customers the lead time for its main router chips is going up from 63 weeks to 70 weeks due to a lack of substrates, according to one person, who asked not to be named as the information is not public. The crunch shows how vulnerable global supply chains remain to disruptions almost two years into the COVID-19 pandemic. Companies and investors have almost no visibility into where the next shock could come from. “This crisis caught a number players off guard,” said Peter Hanbury, a partner at Bain & Co. “As demand for PCs, gaming cards and cloud services increased with COVID-19 and working from home, this critical component suddenly became a real bottleneck for many players such as AMD and Nvidia.” The squeeze is turning low-profile companies like Nan Ya into stock market stars. Its shares have soared 1,219% in the past three years through Wednesday, and analysts project more to come. ABF substrate makers such as Unimicron Technology Corp., Kinsus Interconnect Technology Corp., and Ibiden Co. have all seen their stocks climb too. “Profits at these companies are expected to keep soaring for years to come as shipment quantities skyrocket,” said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research Institute. Nan Ya rose as much as 3.2% Thursday, while Unimicron gained 3.9% and Kinsus added 2.7%. ABF substrate is a relatively new component, pioneered by Intel in the late 1990s as it developed more powerful microprocessors. It takes its name from Ajinomoto Co., a Japanese company that produces the substrate’s film-like insulation. The material was first adopted as the preferred packaging technology for central processing units in personal computers and servers because it facilitates speedy computations by high-end chips.  Sales of ABF substrates surged in the early 2000s with the Internet boom, then took a hit as smartphones began replacing PCs in the late 2000s. Substrate makers’ fortunes started to recover around 2018 as countries began to roll out fifth-generation wireless services, which led companies like Broadcom that make networking chips to adopt the material for use in routers, base stations and related applications. The advent of 5G also boosted demand for more powerful server chips to handle cloud computing, artificial intelligence and smart-driving technologies. The cost of ABF substrate, usually quoted per chip, starts at about 50 cents a chip and tops $20 for premium server CPUs. Major semiconductors companies like Intel, AMD and Nvidia now all depend on ABF substrates to produce the most powerful chips in the world. But substrate makers have been reluctant to invest aggressively in capacity because of money-losing slumps in the past. Supply is expected to rise at a compound annual growth rate of 16% through 2024, while demand is estimated to climb 18% to 19%, Citigroup Inc. analysts Grant Chi and Takayuki Naito forecast in early July.  Owen Cheng, an analyst at President Capital Management Corp., wrote in a note this month that the gap between demand and supply will rise as much as 33% next year compared to this year because of growth in technologies like high-performance computing and artificial intelligence. That will probably benefit the likes of Nan Ya and Unimicron. “Nan Ya could raise its ABF substrates price by 35% in 2022,” Cheng wrote. The ABF situation adds to a series of bottlenecks in the chip industry that have hampered the global recovery from COVID-19, hitting even giants like Toyota Motor Corp. and Apple Inc. Companies around the world are struggling to produce enough to meet demand. Intel warned in July that revenue in its client computing group will decline sequentially due to constraints from substrates and other components. Broadcom, which sells to companies like Apple and Cisco Systems Inc., declined to comment on its wait times. Some customers are taking matters into their own hands. AMD Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su told analysts in April that the chipmaker would put its own money into increasing capacity at suppliers.  “On the substrate side, in particular, I think there has been under-investment in the industry,” she said. “And so we’ve taken the opportunity to invest in some substrate capacity dedicated to AMD, and that will be something that we continue to do going forward.” Auto chip suppliers will use more ABF substrates as vehicles grow increasingly electrified and digitized. They are, however, struggling to get top priority among substrate makers because they lack the bargaining power of major semiconductor companies like Intel, people familiar with the situation said. That could mean more direct investment in substrate producers or the entry of new ABF substrate players. “Going forward, I expect we’ll see more players change their approach to this segment with a more careful plan to monitor capacity and more efforts to reserve capacity in advance,” said Hanbury of Bain.  Nan Ya is stepping up investment. The company is spending at least NT$8 billion ($289 million) in capital expenditure this year and even more in 2022. The company will boost ABF substrate production capacity 40% from its 2020 level by 2023, according to company spokesman Jack Lu. Even that won’t be enough for customers. “Demand will continue to outpace supply until 2023,” Lu said. Unimicron said in July that most of the company’s ABF substrate capacity has been allocated to various customers up until 2025. The tightness is pushing up profits throughout the industry. Nan Ya is projected to see operating profit almost triple this year as revenue rises 33%, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Citigroup analysts Chi and Naito raised their price targets for all the major ABF substrate makers, including Unimicron, Nan Ya, Kinsus and Ibiden.  Cheng of President Capital Management recently bumped his price target for Nan Ya to NT$570. That’s 27% higher than its current price. ‘We want to be in control’: Frustrated carmakers upend industry after chip shortage shatters their faith in suppliers Sit tight, chip shortage likely to last to 2023, says top supplier to auto industry Semiconductor equipment supplier ASML is profiting big time from continued global chip shortage Texas power failures shut down chip factories, which could send shock waves up the supply chain	3
"Coronavirus Regulation Freight Logistics Operations Procurement Technology Risk Semiconductor shortage, lean inventories stifle memory chip demand Published Oct. 5, 2021 Justin Sullivan via Getty Images Micron's inventory is at its ""leanest level in many years"" as it encounters shortages of integrated circuit components, limiting its ability to meet full demand, CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said on the company's Q4 earnings call. The computer memory chipmaker's days of inventory was 94 for the quarter — ""definitely below the optimal level"" of 100 to 105 days, CFO Dave Zinsner said. Micron is especially lean in finished goods inventory, with that category's value at its lowest level since 2013. Micron's PC customers are encountering their own inventory challenges as they face shortages of other components, slowing near-term demand the COVID-19 pandemic had accelerated. PC-makers have cut back on memory and storage purchases to wait on semiconductors to complete their computer builds, Mehrotra said. Micron's inventory levels fall below optimal range Days of inventory and optimal range (100 to 105 days) since fiscal year 2019 The challenges Micron's customers are having in obtaining other components are slowing the near-term need for memory chips. In September, manufacturers of computer and electronic products saw inventory gains as part shortage issues continued, according to the Institute for Supply Management. Manufacturers have held onto work-in-progress products, waiting for components in short supply like semiconductors to come in as order backlogs increased. Automakers, home appliance manufacturers, consumer electronics companies and other industries producing goods with chips inside have eased output due to the shortage. ""While I expect the shortages to bottom out in the second half, it will take another 1 to 2 years before the industry is able to completely catch up with demand,"" said Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger on the chipmaker's Q2 earnings call. But with unmet end-consumer demand persisting for PCs, Mehrotra said current supply chain constraints are merely ""pushing out"" purchases of its products and that demand will return to normal in a few months. ""It really is all driven by work from home, learn from home,"" Mehrotra said. ""That demand acceleration that has taken place through the pandemic will continue to support a healthy environment for PC in calendar year '22 as well."" Fellow memory chipmaker SK Hynix has also encountered inventory challenges amid the COVID-19 pandemic. It realized that utilizing its production capacity wouldn't be enough, so it tapped deeper into its inventory to keep up, Park Myoung-Soo, SK Hynix's head of DRAM marketing, said on the company's Q2 earnings call. Declining inventory trends in the industry ""are likely to continue into the end of this year and also all the way into next year,"" Park added. Micron's chip supply will have to grow enough to both meet near-term order requirements and replenish its inventory deficit ahead of a rebound in PC-maker demand anticipated by company executives. Micron doesn't ever want inventory below 95 days, according to Zinsner, and inventory levels ""will probably be up a few days"" the next quarter but still below the ideal 100-day figure. Micron's days of inventory was well above 100 prior to fiscal year 2021. Mehrotra said the memory chip industry as a whole has pared back its inventory in recent years, but now Micron's supply is too lean. This is in part due to issues with procuring enough controllers and analog integrated circuits, which will limit the company's large shipments to customers in Q1, Mehrotra said. ""As we already talked about, finished goods inventory is really where we're particularly lean,"" Zinsner said. ""And we do have to make some progress in that space to get ourselves into a better position. But overall, I would say the back half of the year we'll probably be in the optimal range.""

Learn more The chip shortage stifling PS5 and Xbox Series X supply could be drawing to an end By Ali Jones 8 days ago Things ""will get better in 2022"" according to AMD CEO (Image credit: Sony / Microsoft) The global chip shortage making it difficult to acquire new consoles and graphics cards could be coming to an end, but supplies will remain ""tight"" for now according to AMD's CEO. Speaking at the Code Conference 2021 (via The Verge), Lisa Su, CEO and president of hardware provider AMD said that the situation ""will get better in 2022,"" although supplies will remain ""tight"" through the end of this year and ""likely tight"" in the first half of next year. Unfortunately, it'll likely be a gradual shift ""as more [production] plants come up"" rather than a quick fix, but that's certainly better than nothing. It's been difficult to get hold of graphics cards created by both AMD and its biggest competitor in the gaming space, Nvidia, due to both a shortage of parts and a recent cryptocurrency boom. As more chips start to be manufactured and with factors like China's recent crackdown on crypto mining - in which the country's government declared the practice an ""illegal financial activity"" - in play, it should get significantly easier to find the parts you need for your next gaming PC. Finding a PS5 or an Xbox Series X might also get easier, as the chips involved in graphics card manufacture are also used to make consoles. That said, Toshiba, which makes the power-regulating chips these electronics require, says that supplies might be slim until next September, and that some customers might be waiting until 2023 for their new tech.

"THE GLOBAL AUTHORITY ON PC GAMES PC Gamer is supported by its audience. When you buy through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more The chip shortage could turn into a chip oversupply by 2023 states analyst firm By Jacob Ridley 16 days ago Well that would be quite the change of pace. The chip shortage could turn into a chip oversupply by 2023, according to analyst firm IDC. That's perhaps not a fix-all solution for those desperate for new graphics silicon today, but, hey, at least it offers some hope that this isn't going to last forever, right? The IDC report (via The Register) notes that it expects the semiconductor industry to see ""normalisation and balance by the middle of 2022, with a potential for overcapacity in 2023 as larger scale capacity expansions begin to come online towards the end of 2022."" Manufacturing capacity is also said to be already maxed out for 2021, meaning every fab is booked up for the remainder of the year. Though it's reportedly looking a little better for fabless companies (i.e. AMD, Nvidia) to get hold of the chips they need. Although with that comes warning of material shortages and slowdowns to back-end manufacturing (all the processes needing to be done to the wafer after it's been produced). RECOMMENDED VIDEOS FOR YOU... With the added pressure of the holiday shopping bonanza towards the end of the year, and low supply leading up to the busy period, I'd take a guess that we, as customers, are unlikely to feel the benefits of the somewhat improved supply—I'm happy to be proven wrong, however. But that's still good news regarding next year and into 2023, although largely in line with what we've heard from Intel and TSMC over the past year in regards to supply issues. As for what large-scale capacity expansions are on the way, there are a multitude of fabrication plant projects in the works. Intel, Samsung, and TSMC (to name only the largest) are all planning entirely new advanced chipmaking facilities, including heaps in the US.  However, the majority of these fabs won't be powered on and pumping out chips until much later than 2022. Intel's Ocotillo Fab in Arizona. (Image credit: Intel) How to buy a graphics card: tips on buying a graphics card in the barren silicon landscape that is 2021 So an improvement like the one the IDC report must also depend on investment going into maintaining, improving, and expanding existing foundry capacity. As new process nodes begin to reach volume production that too will also help ease current congestion. Manufacturers will be cautious to going overboard in increasing supply, though. They're selling absolutely everything they can build right now and overdelivering on the supply front could leave them swimming in leftover chips or having to drop prices. That actually happened to Nvidia once, and it did not end well.  It's a bit of a tightrope: on the one hand, the massive potential in serving more products to more customers; on the other, the potential to be left with expensive fabs not making as much profit as they could be. As all this correlates to gamers, it's graphics cards that appear the most affected by silicon shortages and massive demand more than any other component. GPU prices have appeared to drop substantially since early year highs, although the latest reports suggest we're not out of the woods yet. So I wouldn't expect major shifts in graphics card supply in 2021, even if the IDC report rings true. I will say, though, that since both analyst and CEO seem to agree that 2023 will be back to normal, I'm quietly hopeful for that outcome. At least that way we might stand a chance of picking up at least an Nvidia RTX 4000-series or AMD RX 7000-series graphics card at MSRP—even if that means leaving this potentially awesome generation as a bit of a damp squib.

"U.S. markets close in 22 minutes  Nissan plans Mexico work stoppages in October due to chip shortage Wed, October 6, 2021, 11:36 PM·1 min read A general view shows part of the Nissan manufacturing complex in Aguascalientes MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Japanese automaker Nissan will carry out temporary work stoppages at two Mexican plants for several days in October because of production adjustments needed to manage a shortage of semiconductor chips, its Mexico unit said on Wednesday. Nissan will halt operations at its plant 2 in the central state of Aguascalientes for 11 days in October, and its CIVAC plant in Morelos state will be halted for 8 days, the carmaker said in emailed comments to Reuters. The stoppages come as automotive production in Brazil and Mexico, Latin America's two largest economies, plunged in September, dragged down by an industry-wide semiconductor chip shortage and railroad blockades in Mexico. ""We continue to make adjustments to our production process to minimize the impact this has had on the automotive industry locally and globally,"" said Nissan, adding it was working to recover production and make good on delivery of vehicles to distributors and customers.

Please contact customerservices@lexology.com Milkshakes, chicken and chips: supply issues in the post-pandemic world Stevens & Bolton LLP European Union, United Kingdom October 5 2021 Supply chain problems have been hitting the headlines in recent weeks with food chain Nando’s running out of chicken and McDonalds running out of milkshakes. This is not a new phenomenon though as global automotive production has been suffering from a lack of semi-conductor chips for a considerable time. Supply chain disruption is being attributed to a number of factors: shortage of delivery drivers due to fewer drivers entering the UK post-Brexit, increased border controls and customs regulations causing longer wait times, the rise of the Covid “pingdemic” requiring drivers and production line staff to isolate and (in the case of the automotive sector), demand for semi-conductors outstripping supply, coupled with an increase in raw material prices. For a manufacturer facing these challenges, it is important to remember what it has agreed to supply, and by when, by reviewing its customer contract. However, in times of adversity, is there any “wriggle room” regarding this manufacturing commitment? Earlier this year, in the much-publicised supply dispute involving the European Commission and Astra Zeneca, the European Court addressed this issue in deciding what was meant by “best reasonable endeavours” to supply Covid vaccines to the EU; and ultimately accepting Astra Zeneca’s arguments that its delivery commitments were somewhat flexible. A manufacturer may want to see if any “force majeure” clause in its agreement may be of assistance. Such clauses allow a party to suspend or extinguish their obligations due to events out of their control, perhaps due to fire, flood, a natural disaster, war, a strike or, if specifically drafted, epidemic or pandemic. A commercial approach to dealing with supply chain issues is encouraged and a manufacturer is often better-off being upfront with its customer as to likely supply issues. This may be through a contract “re-set”, or if this is not an option and there remains a tension between the parties, through the engagement of a third party (such as a mediator) to explore potential for a commercial solution. A formal dispute process should be a last resort as it can irreparably damage business relationships not to mention be a costly exercise – financially and reputationally – whatever the outcome. The European Commission/Astra Zeneca dispute is an example of how a supply dispute can quickly escalate. Yet the decision of the European Court to order a staged vaccine delivery programme, with the “sting” of penalties if deadlines were missed, is helpful in showing how courts can adopt a commercial approach. For suppliers able to meet their supply commitments but faced with customers who are experiencing cashflow problems, a supplier should be weary of favouring one customer over another. Whilst prioritising customers is ultimately a commercial decision, it will still be bound by manufacturing and delivery commitments in its other contracts. From a customer’s perspective, business failure of a supplier can cause severe distress and risk them being left out of pocket for goods paid for upfront, or unable to meet orders for their own products. Steps can be taken to try to avoid this scenario: customers should conduct due diligence on suppliers before exchanging contracts to determine their financial health; supply contracts can provide for ownership of goods to pass to customers upon manufacture rather than delivery, so that those goods can be ring-fenced if the supplier went into insolvency; or a customer may consider spreading risk across several suppliers, or take out insurance against supplier insolvency. However, as the last year has illustrated, unforeseen events can turn any successful business into a struggling one without much warning. If a supplier enters insolvency, some customers may want to cut ties and move on. Contracts typically entitle a customer to terminate upon the supplier’s insolvency. If a supplier enters administration, a statutory moratorium prevents customers from taking certain actions (including legal proceedings) against a distressed supplier without the administrator’s consent or court permission. A similar situation arises if a supplier seeks the benefit of a temporary moratorium as is now possible without entering administration. The moratorium should not prevent a customer from exercising its contractual rights, such as termination or retention of title rights (although it will fetter the customer’s ability physically to repossess the goods). If the business continues trading whilst in administration, the buyer may want to fulfil any incomplete orders, and there may be scope for negotiation around future supplies. Where there are no other interested buyers or alternative suppliers, a customer may consider purchasing part of the supplier’s business itself to ensure continued supply. If customers pay for goods in advance and the supplier enters insolvency, the goods are unlikely to be handed over unless title has already passed. The liquidator or administrator will only reimburse deposits if sufficient funds are available but in practice this rarely happens, as customers usually rank as unsecured creditors. Undoubtedly these are challenging times. The combination of two seismic events such as a global pandemic following a major political upheaval will continue to send shockwaves through the manufacturing sector as businesses have to re-adjust and diversify into new ways of working.

General Motors President Mark Reuss said on Tuesday the global supply of semiconductor chips will begin to stabilize but at lower levels than the auto industry wants as it tries to rebuild vehicle inventories. ""We're going to see a stablization to some extent before we see getting the volume we really need,"" Reuss said at a conference hosted by the Detroit Regional Chamber on Mackinac Island in northern Michigan. The global chip shortage has caused GM and automakers globally to idle production at plants, with some executives warning the issue could linger into 2023. GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said last week GM expects a ""more stable year"" in 2022 for chip suppliers, but warned third-quarter wholesale deliveries could be down by 200,000 vehicles due to the shortage. Looking ahead, Reuss said a crucial issue for the auto industry would be recycling materials used in electric vehicle (EV) batteries, such as rare earth minerals. ""There are a lot of material in a battery cell that can be reused,"" he said. ""We are spending time on that."" GM in July said it was investing in a U.S. lithium project that could become the country's largest by 2024, making the No. 1 U.S. automaker one of the first to develop its own source of a battery metal needed for EVs.

"Last Updated 20 days ago Chip supply, testing woes to further curb light vehicle production in 2021- IHS Markit Engine casting blocks, used in a variety of General Motors cars, trucks and crossovers, move down the assembly line at the GM Romulus Powertrain plant in Romulus, Michigan, U.S. August 21, 2019. Rebecca Cook Sept 16 (Reuters) - Semiconductor shortages and the delayed packaging and testing of the chips will cause production of global light vehicles to drop by five million this year, data firm IHS Markit said on Thursday, marking the biggest cut to its outlook in nine months. Citing supply chain challenges, IHS said it was cutting its light vehicle production forecast by 6.2% for 2021 and 9.3% for 2022, to stand at 75.8 million units and 82.6 million units, respectively. Packaging and testing operations within the semiconductor sector in Malaysia were impacted due to the government's lockdown measures in early June, IHS said, compounding difficulties in an already constrained supply chain. ""Our interpretation of the situation in Malaysia, which is responsible for 13% of the global supply of semiconductors for the automotive industry, has become more pessimistic,"" IHS said. ""The two-and-a-half-month backlog that has built up since June will take time to clear and is anticipated to extend well into 2022."" Automakers from General Motors (GM.N) to Japan's Toyota (7203.T) have slashed output and sales forecasts due to scarce chip supplies, made worse by a COVID-19 resurgence in key Asian semiconductor production hubs. IHS said the semiconductor snafus have resulted in lost production of 1.44 million units in the first quarter and a further 2.6 million units in the second quarter. Currently, losses in the quarter are running at 3.1 million units and rising, nearly double its previous forecast. ""The outlook for Q4 now reflects heightened risk as challenges to the supply chain – primarily semiconductors – remain entrenched.""

Why an India-Taiwan mega chip deal could be a global save Both countries are working out a deal that could bring chip manufacturing to South Asia. Here’s why a mega chip deal between India and Taiwan is a global rescue. (Photo by Punit PARANJPE / AFP) Officials from Taiwan and India are discussing a US$7.5 billion chip plant in India that could produce semiconductors for things like 5G-powered products and electric cars On top of setting up a chip fabrication plant by end-2020, both countries are considering reducing tariffs on components used in chip production Chip crunch forces the world’s largest automakers to cut production Back in 2018, Taiwan and India inked an agreement to expand investments and economic ties between the two nations. Both countries are apparently taking their relationship up a notch with an envisioned chip plant worth an estimated US$7.5 billion, to be built in India. If materialized, it would bring chip manufacturing to South Asia by the end of the year, complemented with tariff reductions on components for chip production. First reported by Bloomberg, people familiar with the matter said officials in New Delhi and Taipei have met in recent weeks to discuss a deal that would bring a semiconductor chip plant to India, to supply everything from 5G devices to electric cars. Bloomberg noted that India is currently studying possible locations with adequate land, water, and manpower resources. India reportedly said it would provide financial support by fronting half of the capital expenditure needed from 2023, along with tax breaks and other incentives. It was also said that officials in Taipei wanted quick progress on the bilateral investment agreement, in light of the deepening global semiconductor drought. While Taipei may hope the investment deal will eventually lead to a long-sought-after free trade deal, there could be hesitance from New Delhi on this front over fears of how China might retaliate economically. Can a plant by India and Taiwan solve the global shortage? India’s semiconductor demand is said to be valued at around US$24 billion and is expected to reach US$100 billion by 2025. The country’s semiconductor demand currently is entirely met through imports. But like elsewhere, chip shortages in India have crippled companies ranging from local carmakers to smartphone manufacturers. And when it comes to having a fabrication operation wholly based in India, Taiwan has some hesitancy regarding logistics, according to the Bloomberg report. First and foremost, a typical semiconductor fab operates in a highly controlled environment, requiring an unfluctuating power supply, high-quality water supply, reliable zero downtime, as well as regular maintenance and repair of cleanrooms and equipment.  Hence the concerns from Taiwan — the lack of a proper ecosystem to set up a chip fabrication plant in India. Apparently, the Taiwanese party has flagged concerns on the supply of water and electricity, and suggested that it may be more feasible for India to start creating a chip design sector first, before proceeding to build fabs. Facebook is developing custom chips for its data centers Setting aside the daunting logistics issues, the reality is that the project would not really solve the semiconductor crisis for now. Even if a deal is met anytime soon, the whole process would likely take years before it bears significant fruit. A Gartner report highlighted that the present semiconductor shortage is likely to last until the second half of 2022.  And even if the project between India and Taiwan moved at lightning pace, it is almost impossible to start production before 2023 at best. The scale of production may also be an issue —  one of the reasons why there is a global shortage in semiconductors right now. Given how production cannot be pushed at short notice, it takes chip manufacturers a long time to catch up with demand. Bloomberg points out that chip lead times, AKA the period between ordering semiconductors and time-to-market, rose to a record 21 weeks in August, from six weeks in July. To top it off, any such facility will need a steady source of highly skilled workers, and acquiring the right workforce at scale would also consume another valuable resource — time. Talks on having to be less dependent on imported chips have been percolating among Indian companies for some time now. Perhaps a new plant, if it ever happens, would lead to a more managed risk for India when it comes to its distressed semiconductor supply chain.

Some Automakers Say Chip Shortage Causing a Delay of Certain Features Cadillac to suspend Super Cruise driver assistance system in Escalade SUVs Updated October 5, 2021  shares of the article The global chip shortage—which continues to squeeze most industries that manufacture electronics, or products with electronics in them—is now affecting popular high-tech features as some automakers opt to withhold them or pause production altogether. Consumers already have felt the shock of limited availability of new cars, which has pushed up prices and made it difficult to get sought-after models. That, in turn, has put pressure on the used car market, inflating those prices to all-time highs.  Because of the chip shortage, Cadillac said recently that it would temporarily suspend including its Super Cruise driver assistance system in new Escalade SUVs. Super Cruise—an advanced driver assistance and monitoring system that allows the driver to remove hands from the steering wheel on certain well-marked highways—has a steering column-mounted sensor that ensures the driver always has eyes on the road. The system also includes an array of other outward-facing sensors that are controlled by microchip processors. Choosing It, Insuring It, Driving It Get everything you need to know when it comes to your vehicle. MORE ON CAR BUYING Chip Shortage Makes It Tough to Buy Cars How to Navigate Surging New-Car Prices How to Navigate Surging Used-Car Prices Consider Fixing the Car You Own CR's Car Buying Guide General Motors—Cadillac’s parent company, which also builds Chevrolet vehicles—says it is pausing production of the Bolt EUV, an electric hatchback that is supposed to include Super Cruise. But the manufacturer says that hiatus is related to an EV battery recall on those vehicles, and not the semiconductor shortage. Consumer Reports contacted other manufacturers, some of which say they will dial back optional features on certain models while the semiconductor supply problem persists. (Their responses are below.) Mitsubishi says it has to change options packages to address its limited ability to include blind spot monitoring and some in-dash screens. Other automakers gave more general descriptions of the impact of the chip shortage on options availability. BMW, for example, tells CR that there will be “some limitations on the availability of certain optional equipment.” Stellantis, the multinational corporation that owns popular brands including Jeep and Dodge, says “there might be adjustments in the specification of vehicles.” Mercedes-Benz says that buyers may be able to purchase cars without certain features now and have them retrofitted later. Other manufacturers, including Jaguar Land Rover, Mazda, Nissan, Subaru, and Toyota, say that although the chip shortage is having an impact on overall vehicle production, they’re not limiting features as a way to deal with the problem. Almost all of the manufacturers that responded to CR were clear that the chip shortage will not affect the availability of safety equipment. Cadillac is no exception, and it’s important to note that Super Cruise, although innovative and effective, is a convenience feature, and not safety equipment. “In our tests, Super Cruise is a welcome feature that can make driving on the highway less stressful,” says Jake Fisher, senior director of CR’s Auto Test Center. “The Escalade will still be sold with proven safety features such as automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection.”  Check Your New Car for Promised Features Consumers should be aware when shopping that some new cars might not have the features they’re looking for right now. Don’t rely on the salesperson to tell you what features are included—check for yourself. Because this problem is likely to persist, CR recommends making a list of the features you want, and the ones that are must-haves. If you can’t find a new car with the features you need, it may be best to wait until they become available again on the model you’re interested in buying. Analysts say that the tight supply of microchips isn’t going away anytime soon and that the situation could last a year or longer. Auto manufacturing has felt the squeeze more acutely than most other industries, which you may have noticed if you’ve been out looking for cars over the past few months. Inventories are low as manufacturers struggle to keep up with demand. “We’re now seeing companies like Toyota that had previously stockpiled a bunch of chips starting to run out and cut production through the end of the year,” says Sam Abuelsamid, principal research analyst for Guidehouse Insights, a firm that tracks the automotive industry. “The total lost production volume could end up being more than 7.7 million vehicles.” To put that into perspective, in 2019—the last full year before the pandemic ground car buying and production to a halt for a while—automakers sold more than 17 million vehicles in the U.S. In 2020, sales fell sharply but still hit almost 15 million vehicles. Here’s what manufacturers are saying about the impacts of the chip shortage on their operations. American Honda Motor Co. (Honda and Acura) “It has no impact on the vehicles we deliver to our customers, as Honda Sensing is standard on nearly everything. Thus, we are not making choices to cut those features because of the chip shortage.” “Based on the new vehicles we are offering, they do indeed all still offer our standard and optional equipment—no changes in offering.” “Due to the worldwide semiconductor shortage affecting the entire automotive industry, there may be some limitations on the availability of certain optional equipment.” Ford Motor Company (Ford and Lincoln) General Motors  (Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, and GMC) “Due to the industry-wide shortage of semiconductors, we’ve had to periodically make temporary adjustments to vehicle content on various models. When this happens, it is critical that we notify our dealer partners first so that they can keep our customers informed. The semiconductor situation remains fluid and these adjustments fluctuate frequently as semiconductor supply increases. We’re confident in our team’s ability to find creative solutions to mitigate the supply chain situation and resume offering all planned features for our customers as soon as possible.” “Super Cruise is an important feature for the Cadillac Escalade program. Although it’s temporarily unavailable at the start of regular production due to the industry-wide shortage of semiconductors, we’re confident in our team’s ability to find creative solutions to mitigate the supply chain situation and resume offering the feature for our customers as soon as possible.”  “The semiconductor shortage is having no impact on feature availability. This includes smart cruise control and AEB.” “The chip shortage is impacting the total build of vehicles, but not resulting in vehicles built without safety features.” Kia says that it is not aware of any issues providing normally available features but that it has had to suspend production several times this year due to the semiconductor shortage. “Although the infection situation in Southeast Asia is improving, our local suppliers are experiencing delays in normalizing their operations after the lockdown, causing disruptions in the procurement of parts, including semiconductor-related ones. We therefore will suspend night shifts for two weeks; the week of October 11th and the week of October 18th. We will also shut down the operations at the engine plant in Ujina and the transmission plant in Hofu Nakanoseki area. We will continue to strengthen our collaboration with suppliers to minimize the impact.” “Due to the effects of the current worldwide supply shortage for certain semiconductor components, there are currently equipment restrictions in certain model series, for example in the compact car segment. This also results in delays in delivery. “We are in dialogue with the affected customers regarding individual mobility solutions. In some markets, this includes, for example, the possibility that customers can choose the originally agreed delivery date of their vehicle with the associated functional restrictions or adequate alternative mobility solutions. The functions will be retrofitted as soon as the corresponding components are available again.” Mitsubishi Motors North America “Like everyone, we are balancing component availability with customer demand. We’ve seen a particular shortage for sensors used for rear cross-traffic alerts and blind-spot monitoring, as well as in-dash screens and monitors, and have had to adjust the mix to compensate. That said, we have not removed or adjusted the availability of any vehicles equipped with AEB. We continue to work hand-in-glove with our supplier partners on sourcing, and we’re hopeful that we’re on the right side of the shortage at this point.” Nissan says the chip shortage is not affecting the availability of advanced driver assistance features on vehicles so equipped. “Nissan is adjusting production schedules within our North American manufacturing operations in October due to semiconductor-related parts supply. We continue to work closely with our supplier partners to assess the impact of supply chain issues and minimize disruption for vehicle deliveries to our dealers and customers.” “Customer satisfaction is our number one priority. The global automotive industry faces an exceptional situation with the accumulation of the health crisis and a worldwide shortage of semiconductors. Our teams are mobilized to drive our manufacturing activity in this unstable context and we need to adapt accordingly. Despite our daily effort aiming at delivering to our customers in the best possible situation, and in order to help minimize the impact on vehicle availability, there might be adjustments in the specification of vehicles.” “Our overall vehicle production has been impacted by the chip shortage, but we have not reduced the availability of our advanced safety features, including the EyeSight driver assist system, on any of our models.” Tesla Motors disbanded its press office and no longer responds to media inquiries. Toyota (Toyota and Lexus) “Due to COVID-19 and ongoing challenges with our supply chain, Toyota will continue to face shortages that will affect production at most of our North American plants. Our manufacturing and supply chain teams are working diligently to minimize the impact on production. Though the situation remains fluid, in North America, we are projecting a reduction of approximately 60,000 to 80,000 vehicles in October.” “A significant shortage of semiconductor capacities is leading to various supply bottle-necks in many industries around the world (consumer electronics, computers, telecommunications etc.). Because of growing demand for consumer electronics (e.g. due to remote working arrangements) on the one hand and the high level of demand in the automotive markets on the other, supply bottlenecks are still occurring in the automotive industry. The result is industry-wide adaptations in vehicle production, which also affects the brands of the Volkswagen Group. “In recent months, the Volkswagen Group’s task force has been working intensely and successfully to minimize the effects of the global semiconductor bottleneck on products in the Group. This is why, notwithstanding the strained situation, production at Volkswagen Group plants has only had to be adjusted at times up to now.” “Similar to the entire automotive and electronics industries, Volvo Cars has experienced a shortage of semiconductors since the end of 2020. The company is adjusting production, as well as individual vehicle features and options, to adapt to the shortage situation. There has been no impact to any standard safety systems, Pilot Assist or Adaptive Cruise Control, though customers are advised to work closely with their retailers before purchasing to understand exactly how their vehicles are otherwise equipped.” My reporting has taken me everywhere from Baghdad, Iraq, to the Detroit auto show, along the U.S.-Mexico border and everywhere in between.

NEWS HARDWARE GAMING MOBILE FINANCE DEALS REVIEWS TSMC Will Prioritize Companies Who Are Not Stockpiling Chips as It Plans to Invest $100 Billion to Increase Manufacturing Capacity Oct 6, 2021 09:14 EDT TSMC is taking various steps to deal with the ongoing chip shortage. Previously, price hikes and other measures such as prioritizing companies like Apple were being followed, but according to the latest interview, companies who are not stockpiling chips will now be considered for future orders. TSMC Reportedly Had a Team to Collect Data Across Supply Chains to Find out Which of Its Partners Were Stockpiling Chips TSMC’s chairman Mark Liu, in an interview with Time Magazine, commented on how his firm is dealing with the chip shortage. While injecting $100 billion to increase manufacturing capacity over the next three years seems like the right step, the move will not be sufficient as demand grows for cutting-edge wafers, so the company has to take a drastic decision. Intel Begins Construction of Fab 52 and Fab 62 Chip Foundries in Arizona According to the interview, TSMC accumulated a group of people who collected data to find out which of the manufacturer’s partners were stockpiling chips. While it is a prudent move to stockpile chips in the event that the shortage worsens over time, TSMC’s chairman says that such companies will not be prioritized for future orders. However, the semiconductor giant might give preference to partners who require much higher chip shipments than others, such as Apple. Just recently, we reported that Apple has asked TSMC to increase A15 Bionic orders while scaling back on previous-generation iPhone parts. We believe the ongoing chip shortage might have forced Apple to let TSMC focus its efforts and resources towards producing more N5P wafers rather than churning out chips for older iPhones. It is also possible that the growing demand for the iPhone 13 has forced Apple to increased A15 Bionic orders. Despite an increase in its investment, TSMC might face massive roadblocks that will force it to delay 3nm chips for Apple. The company was previously reported to have increased 5nm chip prices for Apple as it attempts to combat the deleterious effects of the shortage, even though that price jump was just 3 percent. Still, expect future products from the California-based giant to be pricier if the shortage saga does not end. In your opinion, do you think TSMC is making the right move prioritizing companies who are not stockpiling chips? It is a gamble for such partners because they never know when their turn will arrive to receive the next shipment, but do you think it is the right decision? Share your thoughts down in the comments.

Live Now: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jen Psaki #wh-oval-615e012bdd858 .st0{fill:#0A2458;} #wh-oval-615e012bdd858 .st1{fill-rule:evenodd;clip-rule:evenodd;fill:#FFFFFF;} #wh-oval-615e012bdd858 .st2{opacity:0.5;fill:#FFFFFF;} #wh-oval-615e012bdd858 .st3{fill:#FFFFFF;} TO SEARCH THIS SITE, ENTER A SEARCH TERM When the Chips Are Down: Preventing and Addressing Supply Chain Disruptions By: Sameera Fazili and Peter Harrell Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the things consumers and producers wanted, from cars to toilet paper to yeast to lumber, simply appeared in showrooms, on store shelves, and in ports to be purchased and used when convenient. But over the last 18 months, we’ve seen shortages in goods large and small, often due to surprisingly small causes and hidden vulnerabilities.  For example, the demand for yeast quadrupled in spring 2020, as homebound Americans tried their hand at making bread. Fleischmann’s Yeast, a major producer, had capacity to make yeast; it was lack of packaging that led to shortages and delays. The glass jars used to package the yeast were sourced from India, where production had been shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[1] Nimble firms resolved some of these shortages quickly. Fleischmann’s figured out how to package yeast in plastic bags, and toilet paper manufacturers made numerous small adjustments to equipment and product mix.[2] Others, like the semiconductor chip shortage, have proven harder to resolve and are dragging down the US economy. Some analysts estimate the chip shortage could cut nearly a percentage point from GDP growth this year, and it has resulted in waves of production shutdowns that have hurt the hundreds of thousands of U.S. workers employed in manufacturing jobs across the automotive and heavy trucking sectors.[3] The ability to recover quickly from an unexpected shock is a hallmark of a resilient system. When it comes to manufacturing supply chains, firms often adopt three inter-related strategies to strengthen resiliency: Visibility: The capability to monitor the supply chain, often in real time. Buffer: Having multiple sources of supply or holding more inventory. Agility: The ability to pivot quickly to alternative processes or products. However, an individual firm’s ability to pivot quickly in the face of a shock can be limited by collective action problems—including a lack of communication and trust between firms along a supply chain—and a lack of access to the data necessary to support visibility and agility. Government has a unique ability to solve coordination challenges and serve as a trusted source of data. This role is especially critical at times of shortage, to counter the tendency of downstream firms, like manufacturers of finished goods, to overorder or hoard inventory and of upstream firms, like manufacturers of the inputs, to not fulfill orders due to a lack of trust in the demand signal, which results in shortages, delays, price increases, and uncertainty for the workers, families, and small businesses who ultimately depend on these goods. Renewing our Commitment to Transparency and Agility Since April, the Administration has used its convening power to strengthen communication and trust between the firms that produce semiconductors—including those that design chips, produce wafers, and assemble them into devices—and those that use semiconductors—including automakers, consumer electronics firms, and medical device firms. The result has been a change in supply chain management practices by firms like General Motors, which announced new efforts to build more direct working relationships with semiconductor suppliers who are downstream suppliers to GM. It also includes a growing recognition by chip producers that industrial sectors like the automotive industry represent a growing customer base. This is progress, and we continue to look to industry to take further steps to improve transparency, trust, and communication to address supply chain bottlenecks. Today, the Department of Commerce is taking new steps to improve data collection, by conducting a voluntary survey of industry participants to both diagnose chokepoints in the supply chain and offer firms data that can help them adapt their production processes to adjust to the supply shortage. For example, the survey may show that the chips used in sensors that help activate a pacemaker and power the safety features of a car are in shortage, but not the ones that support power management on a device. In this way, the information can also provide a clear demand signal that can attract more private investment to expand capacity to resolve the shortage. In addition, to address shocks to global supply chains stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been working with foreign governments in Southeast Asia and elsewhere to keep critical factories up and running, while putting worker health and safety and the public health response of our trading partners at the center of our efforts. The Biden-Harris Administration is building on this work by standing up a new early alert system for COVID-related shutdowns to microelectronics manufacturing around the world. The system will allow us to detect potential disruptions earlier, and support faster problem solving and coordination with our trading partners and the private sector, balancing a focus on worker health and safety, supporting the public health response, and safely re-opening plants. This system is also designed to protect proprietary or business sensitive information for companies that voluntarily participate. The Commerce Department will be industry’s entry point, and they will work closely with the State Department—both here in Washington and also at our Embassies abroad. We will also rely on technical experts from USAID and the CDC to carry out this mission. Preventing the Next Chips Shortage In the longer term, however, the U.S. must take stronger action to identify and get ahead of vulnerabilities in the supply chains of critical goods. Supply chain shocks are not unexpected. A McKinsey Global Institute analysis found that supply-chain shocks affecting global production lasting at least a month occur on average every 3.7 years, leading companies to lose 42 percent of one year’s earnings every ten years. The climate crisis is causing supply chain-disrupting “100-year” events more frequently and with greater ferocity, due to increased intensity and frequency of storms, droughts, and other extreme weather events. U.S workers, consumers, and businesses will continue to suffer from disruptions and price shocks unless we take action, across the public and private sector and with partners and allies, to build more resilient supply chains. That is why the President has taken swift and persistent action to address supply chain vulnerabilities since he came into office. In February, he ordered a 100-day review of supply chains for select critical products and a 1-year review of vulnerabilities in the supply chains for select critical sectors. The 100-day report, published in June, lays out a framework for closing supply chain vulnerabilities by investing in U.S. workers, communities, and innovation. It also makes the case for a new federal toolbox for closing these vulnerabilities. This includes the capacity to map and monitor current gaps and conduct stress tests to identify future vulnerabilities, funding to support applied research on best practices on supply chain resiliency at both the firm-level and national-level, and financial tools including grants and loans to pull forward private sector investments in resiliency, countering the private market’s tendency to overinvest in short-term cost control and underinvest in resiliency. There are two critical steps that Congress could take to accelerate our progress towards more resilient supply chains. First, Congress could fund the bipartisan CHIPS for America Act, which would enable transformative investments in domestic semiconductor research, design, and manufacturing. This is the long-term solution to solving the current chip shortage. Second, Congress could establish the new Critical Supply Chain Resiliency Program (CSCRP) at the Department of Commerce, which President Biden has proposed as part of his Build Back Better plan that is before Congress right now. The program would serve as a central node in the federal government for supply chain resilience, facilitate better coordination and planning across federal agencies to address vulnerabilities, and invest in critical supply chains where the private market has failed to allocate sufficient capital. Some examples of the activities the new office could support include: Mapping supply chains for critical industries: The U.S. government is trying to prevent disruptions in the supply chains for advanced energy and communications equipment. The CSCRP conducts a survey of firms in each industry, working with industry partners. The data and mapping from the survey allows the office to run stress tests for various shocks, including a cyber attack at a critical node, and run scenario planning exercises to facilitate greater preparedness across the private sector and government agencies to respond to potential shocks to a critical supply chain. Growing domestic clean energy supply chains: A U.S. consortium of green energy companies wishes to onshore the supply chain for manufacturing solar panels, 80% of which are currently made by Chinese companies due in part to Chinese government subsidies. The CSCRP provides low-cost financing to support the development of new U.S. factories so that a larger share of the planned U.S. renewables build-out is U.S.-made. Expanding supply of trusted and secure hardware: A promising early-stage 5G equipment start-up seeks to scale up manufacturing for 5G network infrastructure equipment. However, it has had trouble securing the late-stage funding to commercialize its technology, which has been a longstanding problem that has pushed many U.S. manufacturers offshore. The company is being courted by a contract manufacturer to move its production to Asia. To address this issue, CSCRP provides a direct loan, for one portion of its scale up need, and a loan guarantee for the rest. The federal government must be better equipped to get ahead of possible disruptions and have tools at its disposal to limit their impact on the U.S. economy, workers, and consumers. When supply chain shocks cascade, the spillover effects can impact the global economy in ways that no one firm or sector can anticipate or adequately resolve on their own. By taking a holistic view of the industrial base and supply chains critical to US economic and national security, the federal government can monitor, anticipate, and respond to economic, geopolitical, and climate-related shocks. The CHIPS Act and the CSCRP are two important steps towards our goal of strengthening our nation’s longer term economic competitiveness, our national security, and advancing the President’s 21st century industrial strategy. The key to resolving the next global supply chain crisis is preventing it from happening in the first place.

PS5 and Xbox supplier AMD expects chip shortage to ease in second half of 2022 BUT CEO LISA SU SAYS SUPPLIES WILL LIKELY REMAIN “TIGHT” IN THE FIRST HALF OF NEXT YEAR 4TH OCT 2021 / 3:43 PM AMD, which makes the CPUs and GPUs inside PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, expects chip supply issues to ease gradually in the second half of 2022. Speaking at the Code Conference in California on Monday (via CNBC), AMD CEO Lisa Su said chip supplies for the first half of next year will be “likely tight.” However, she expects the global shortage to be less severe in the second half of 2022 as new manufacturing plants start to bear fruit. “It might take, you know, 18 to 24 months to put on a new plant, and in some cases even longer than that,” Su said. “These investments were started perhaps a year ago.” PLAYSTATION 5 SEPTEMBER SHOWCASE - OPENING SIZZLE Console manufacturers have struggled with stock shortages for over 18 months now, after the Covid-19 pandemic shut down essential supply chains and saw demand for gaming devices increase significantly as countries implemented social distancing measures. Last week, Xbox boss Phil Spencer said current console supply issues will continue into 2022. He told The Wrap that a shortage of chips wasn’t the only thing stopping Microsoft getting as many Xbox Series X/S consoles onto store shelves as it would like.

"I've Always Wondered ... Econ Extra Credit with David Brancaccio Make Me Smart Daily What’s behind the chip shortage? MORE FROM THIS SHOW What’s behind the chip shortage? The chip shortage has been made worse by shipping bottlenecks, worker shortages and supply chain issues. Jens Schlueter/AFP via Getty Images Sign up for the daily Marketplace newsletter to make sense of the most important business and economic news. General Motors announced this week that it’s shutting down production of its main electric vehicle, the Chevy Bolt, through mid-October because of a shortage of batteries driven by the global shortage of semiconductor chips. Marketplace has covered the chip shortage again and again and again. But why exactly is there a chip shortage in the first place? Shortages happen when the demand for something is higher than the supply. When it comes to computer chips, there are problems on both sides of that equation. First, in the pandemic, demand for chips went up. “The consumption of chips has skyrocketed because more and more people are buying computers and various electronic devices as they’re stuck at home,” said Morris Cohen, who teaches operations and information management at The Wharton School. Hosted by Kai Ryssdal When WhatsApp goes down, global communication stops How the U.S. became a tax haven for the globe’s wealthy and elite Could this be the start of a new labor movement? Then, there’s a supply problem. That’s because of natural disasters in at least three countries, according to Art Wheaton at Cornell University’s ILR School. “So, one of the major chip suppliers in Japan had a fire. Texas, for Intel, had a problem with the winter storms. And in Taiwan, which is one of the largest producers in the world of these chips, they’re having a drought — and making computer chips requires lots of water, so they have been impacted,” Wheaton said. Also, the companies that make chips haven’t been able to find enough workers. Not to mention the shipping bottlenecks. “A lot of them go through China as one of the major ports. And they had a COVID outbreak, which stopped people from unloading and loading these container ships,” Wheaton said. “And then when you get a backlog of those, it’s hard to unload them and get caught up, especially if you’re having a labor shortage.” Latest Stories on Marketplace An argument for bringing back a contractual “lottery” for retirement savings Pressure mounts to require parents to work to get the child tax credit Can the shipping industry meet its climate goal for 2050? Though these issues have beleaguered the chip industry broadly, for the car industry, there’s another problem: Carmakers were expecting demand to slow down during the pandemic, so they canceled a lot of their orders for chips. That means that now they’re at the back of the line.

"Free CBS News App Sign Up For Newsletters How Conspiracy Theories ""Infiltrated"" The Wellness Community Chip shortage likely to keep car prices sky-high through 2023 UPDATED ON: SEPTEMBER 8, 2021 / 12:47 PM / CBS/AP Back in the spring, a shortage of computer chips that had sent auto prices soaring appeared to be finally easing. Some relief for consumers seemed to be in sight. But that hope is now fading, as a surge in COVID-19 cases from the Delta variant in several Asian countries is worsening the supply shortage, further delaying a return to normal auto production and keeping the supply of vehicles artificially low. That means record-high consumer prices for vehicles — new and used, as well as rental cars — will likely extend into next year and might not return to earth until 2023, according to analysts. In July, new-car prices hit a new record for the fourth straight month, according to Kelley Blue Book. The average transaction, at $42,736, was 8% higher than one year ago, with a typical new car costing above the manufacturer's suggested retail price. Sales of new cars, meanwhile, have been tumbling a mirror image of prices. In August, new vehicle sales in the U.S. fell nearly 18%, mainly because of supply shortages. Not counting the drop in 2020, August's ""pace of sales is the lowest since late 2011 during the recovery from the Global Financial Crisis,"" Oxford Economics' Mahir Rasheed wrote in a research note.  ""A storm of headwinds including the global semiconductor shortage, expiring fiscal support, and a spending rotation towards services will preclude sales from returning to their early 2021 pace,"" he wrote. The global parts shortage involves not just computer chips. Automakers are starting to see shortages of wiring harnesses, plastics and glass, too. And beyond autos, vital components for goods ranging from farm equipment and industrial machinery to sportswear and kitchen accessories are also bottled up at ports around the world as demand outpaces supply in the face of a resurgent virus. ""Far from getting better, the problems afflicting the world's automakers are getting worse,"" Vincent Tsui of Gavekal Research wrote in a recent research note. Automakers squeezed by the parts shortage have announced closures at multiple North American factories, ranging from several days to two weeks. Kia on Tuesday halted work at its Georgia production plant ""because of supply chain conditions related to the ongoing worldwide semiconductor chip shortage,"" spokesman Rick Douglas told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. He said regular production was slated to resume Wednesday. General Motors idled nearly all of its North America plants starting Monday, with the closures expected to last one to two weeks.  ""These most recent scheduling adjustments are being driven by the continued parts shortages caused by semiconductor supply constraints from international markets experiencing COVID 19-related restrictions,"" GM said in a statement. Late last month, shortages of semiconductors and other parts grew so acute that Toyota felt compelled to announce it would slash production by at least 40% in Japan and North America for two months. The cuts meant a reduction of 360,000 vehicles worldwide in September. Toyota, which largely avoided sporadic factory closures that have plagued rivals this year, now foresees production losses into October. Nissan, which had announced in mid-August that chip shortages would force it to close its immense factory in Smyrna, Tennessee, until August 30, now says the closure will last until September 13. Honda dealers are bracing for fewer shipments. ""This is a fluid situation that is impacting the entire industry's global supply chain, and we are adjusting production as necessary,"" said Chris Abbruzzese, a Honda spokesman. And Tesla CEO Elon Musk told investors in July that the supply of chips — the slowest part of Tesla's supply chain — would dictate the production of its electric vehicles for the rest of the year. ""The chip supply is fundamentally the governing factor on our output,"" he said. ""It is difficult for us to see how long this will last."" With consumer demand for wheels still high, automakers feel little pressure to discount their vehicles. Forced to conserve their scarce computer chips, the automakers have routed them to higher-priced models — pickup trucks and large SUVs, for example — thereby driving up their average prices. The roots of the computer chip shortage bedeviling auto and other industries stem from the eruption of the pandemic early last year. U.S. automakers had to shut factories for eight weeks to help stop the virus from spreading. Some parts companies canceled orders for semiconductors. At the same time, with tens of millions of people hunkered down at home, demand for laptops, tablets and gaming consoles skyrocketed. As auto production resumed, consumer demand for cars remained strong. But chip makers had shifted production to consumer goods, creating a shortage of weather-resistant automotive-grade chips.  Then, just as auto chip production started to rebound in late spring, the highly contagious Delta variant struck Malaysia and other Asian countries where chips are finished and other auto parts are made. Automakers reported that U.S. dealers had fewer than 1 million new vehicles on their lots in August — 72% lower than in August 2019. Even if auto production were somehow to immediately regain its highest-ever level for vehicles sold in the U.S., it would take more than a year to achieve a more normal 60-day supply of vehicles and for prices to head down, the consulting firm Alix Partners has calculated. ""Under that scenario,"" said Dan Hearsch, an Alix Partners managing director, ""it's not until early 2023 before they even could overcome a backlog of sales, expected demand and build up the inventory."" ""More than I paid for my house"" For now, with parts supplies remaining scarce and production cuts spreading, many dealers are nearly out of new vehicles. On a recent visit to the ""Central Avenue Strip"" in suburban Toledo, Ohio, a road chock-full of dealerships, few new vehicles could be found on the lots. Some dealers filled in their lots with used vehicles. One would-be buyer, Heather Pipelow of Adrian, Michigan, said she didn't even bother to look for a new SUV at Jim White Honda. ""It's more than I paid for my house,"" she said ruefully. Ed Ewers of Mansfield, Ohio, traveled about two hours to a Toledo-area Subaru dealer to buy a used 2020 four-door Jeep Wrangler. He considered buying new but decided that a used vehicle was more in his price range to replace an aging Dodge Journey SUV. Glenn Mears, who runs four auto dealerships around Canton, Ohio, suspects the shortage will get worse before it gets better. He said dealers are managing to survive because of the high prices consumers are having to pay for both new and used vehicles. He doesn't charge more than the sticker price, he said — enough profit to cover expenses and make money. Nor does he have to advertise as much or pay interest on a large stock of vehicles. Many vehicles, he said, are sold before they arrive from the factory. No end in sight? Chip orders that were made nine months ago are now starting to arrive. But other components, such as glass or parts made with plastic injection molds, are depleted, Hearsch said. Because of the virus and a general labor shortage, he said, auto-parts makers might not be able to make up for lost production. Some tentative cause for hope has begun to emerge. Siew Hai Wong, president of the Malaysia Semiconductor Industry Association, says hopefully that chip production should start returning to normal in the fall as more workers are vaccinated. Though Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan, Singapore and the U.S. all produce semiconductors, he said, a shortage of just one kind of chip can disrupt production. ""If there is disruption in Malaysia,"" Wong said, ""there will be disruption somewhere in the world."" Automakers have been considering shifting to an order-based distribution system rather than keeping huge supplies on dealer lots. But no one knows whether such a system would prove more efficient. Eventually, Hearsch suggested, the Delta variant will pass and the supply chain should return to normal. By then, he predicts, automakers will line up multiple sources of parts and stock critical components. ""There will be an end to it, but the question is really when,"" said Ravi Anupindi, a professor at the University of Michigan who studies supply chains.

REUTERS/Andreas Gebert MUNICH, Sept 6 (Reuters) - BMW (BMWG.DE) expects supply chains to remain tight well into 2022, Chief Executive Oliver Zipse said on Monday, squashing hopes that a painful shortage of crucial semiconductors will end soon. ""I expect that the general tightness of the supply chains will continue in the next 6 to 12 months,"" he said at the IAA Munich car show. Zipse, who like other car executives is battling lower production due to a lack of semiconductors, said he saw no issues in the long-term, adding that the automotive industry was an attractive client for chipmakers.

"WORKING FROM HOME CLOUD INNOVATION CXO MORE Hunker down: The chip shortage and higher prices are set to linger for a while If your hopes are for semiconductor prices to return to what they used it be, there's nothing but bad news on the horizon. By Chris Duckett for Null Pointer | October 4, 2021 | Topic: Hardware With recent murmurings of chip shortages easing through to 2022, one could be forgiven for imagining some sort of promised land where prices return to the lower levels once remembered. Unfortunately, that idea will have to be consigned to the land of rainbows, pixie dust, and affordable housing in major cities, because while the situation may ease, that doesn't mean it will stop growing. For Gartner senior analyst Ben Lee, the relief slated to arrive in the middle of 2022 is not a lowering of absolute prices, but a slowing in the rate of growth. ""In terms of the chip shortage, [prices will be] not as high before ... or flat, or slightly decreasing,"" Lee told ZDNet. ""So far we don't see that any sign that we're going to see [a] crash."" See also: Intel's $20 billion in new fabs won't end chip shortage In the current environment, with Gartner forecasting 27% revenue growth in the sector and high single digits next year, Lee said the whole supply chain is aggressively trying to build up inventory, and it is an environment that hasn't been seen before. While the pandemic cannot explain all of it, it can explain some of it, as can other supply side issues, rising logistics prices, and pure demand for chips. ""The whole is getting up, the price, not only semiconductor, but also for everything,"" Lee said. ""Logistic and transportation fee, or the crude oil fee ... it's a kind of inflation."" Much like headlines of a Sydney property price bust, the falls will look more like a plateau when zoomed out. Automakers could also be in for a continued dosage of pain as foundries continue to profit from leading fabrication processes as they have little fiscal incentive to push not as profitable legacy electronics, and car makers do not tend to switch chips validated for their models once they are in production. There was little consolation for the auto sector in a Gartner research note that said an oversupply of memory would appear in the second half of 2022, and moving to newer processes was a way to take advantage of it. ""Moving to newer components to secure midterm to long-term supply will enhance business continuity,"" the note said. ""It will also likely result in further cost savings as chip suppliers concentrate technology transitions on mainstream products rather than legacy devices."" Making money: TSMC increases car chip output by 30% amid global chip shortage Last week, Micron posted its second-highest quarterly revenue, proving someone is making money in a tight market. Speaking on the PC market, an area which Micron expects shortages to resolve in the coming months, CEO Sanjay Mehrotra echoed the predictions of a pricing plateau. ""It really is all driven by work-from-home, learn-from-home, the demand acceleration that has taken place through the pandemic will continue to support healthy environment for PC in calendar year '22 as well,"" he said. ""Of course, in 2020 and 2021, PC has gone through a double-digit unit growth in -- on a calendar year basis. We expect that to moderate in calendar year '22 to perhaps from flat to low single-digit year-over-year growth in terms of PC units sold. Yet, it will be a healthy market."" It's important to note that when a tech CEO says ""healthy"" they mean ""nice and profitable"" for them. Mehrotra added that between AI, 5G, data centres, and user devices the company is seeing strong underlying pent-up demand. ""COVID further accelerated it. Semiconductor supply chain shortages are only stretching that demand out because some of the demand gets pushed out,"" he said. ""On the supply chain aspects ... the lead time in the semiconductors is long, and this will take several quarters to continue to improve. ""It's really the combination of the demand drivers and the suppliers' -- supply capabilities and shipment capabilities. That combination, I think, really sets us up well as an industry for revenue growth and strong profitability in '22."" Micron has said it will have record revenue in fiscal year 22, and be solidly profitable. If you were expecting 2022 to be the year that GPU prices might get back some normality, unfortunately like many things in recent years, the new normal is not going to resemble the old normal.

General Motors reported sales fell a third from a year-ago last quarter, and they were off 40% from the same quarter of 2019 before the pandemic roiled the car market. Sales at Stellantis, the company formed by the merger of Fiat Chrysler and France's PSA Group, fell 19% from a year ago, and 27% from the pre-pandemic period. At Toyota Motor, which includes Toyota and Lexus, third quarter sales edged up 1.4% compared to a year ago. But that three-month total includes a 22% plunge in September sales. (The company breaks out monthly sales numbers, unlike GM and Stellantis.) While Toyota has reported fewer supply chain disruptions than other major automakers it, too, has had to cut back production at some factories more recently. So all the automakers pointed to semiconductor supply chain disruptions and historically low inventories as a problem for sales. ""While the various supply chain issues facing our industry continue to impact available inventory, we know the demand for our vehicles is still there,"" said Jeff Kommor, US head of sales for Stellantis. The shortage of vehicles has also led to record-high prices for both new and used cars for much of this year, which has also been a drag on sales, as some buyers have been priced out of the new car market. The auto industry has been dealing with a shortage of computer chips needed to build cars for more than a year. GM (GM) said it expects the situation will improve in the final three months of 2021, but earlier this year automakers had hoped things would have improved by this point. Instead, GM has been forced to temporarily shut production of most of its North American plants. ""The semiconductor supply disruptions that impacted our third-quarter wholesale and customer deliveries are improving,"" said the nation's largest automaker in a statement. ""As we look to the fourth quarter, a steady flow of vehicles held at plants will continue to be released to dealers, we are restarting production at key crossover and car plants, and we look forward to a more stable operating environment through the fall."" Biden official reveals the failure behind America's epic chip shortage The computer chip shortage started when auto sales plunged in the early weeks of the pandemic, due to record job losses and the temporary closure of many factories and dealerships. Most automakers, expecting a prolonged downturn in sales, trimmed orders for computer chips and other parts. When sales rebounded much faster than anyone expected, the supply of chips had already gone to other customers. While the automakers expected to be able to increase their supply of chips by the middle of this year, they were hit by outbreaks of Covid cases in other regions, such as Southeast Asia, where many of the chip plants were shut. And other supply chain issues, including an imbalance of shipping containers and congestion at the nation's ports, a shortage of truck drivers and general labor shortages, started limiting supplies of other needed parts and raw materials. Other automakers are due to report results later Friday or on Monday. Where Do The Richest Americans Live? Dhaka : Online Jobs in the USA May Pay More Than You… It's official.

"Last Updated 40 minutes ago Auto output dives in Brazil, Mexico as chip shortages bite By Sharay Angulo and Alberto Alerigi Cars are seen in a traffic jam during morning rush hour in a period of social isolation in Brasilia, amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, Brazil April 16, 2020. REUTERS/Ueslei Marcelino MEXICO CITY/SAO PAULO, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Automotive production in Brazil and Mexico, Latin America's two largest economies, plummeted in September, dragged down by an industry-wide semiconductor chip shortage and railroad blockades in Mexico, data showed on Wednesday. Brazilian auto production was down 21.3% to 173,287 units in September from the same month in 2020, when the industry was scrambling to resume production from a coronavirus-induced shutdown, Brazilian automakers association Anfavea said. In Mexico, auto output plunged 33.30% from September 2020 to 208,092 vehicles, while auto exports fell by 24.18% to 195,294 units, data from national statistics agency INEGI showed. ""All of this is due to the shortage of semiconductors, which at this point is affecting all levels of production for all participants in the domestic market,"" said the head of the Mexican Automotive Industry Association (AMIA), Fausto Cuevas. A semiconductor chip shortage is causing major auto production cuts around the globe and auto industry officials have warned the problem is getting worse. read more In the latest fallout from the chip shortfall, Japanese automaker Nissan (7201.T) told Reuters it plans to carry out temporary stoppages at two Mexican plants for several days in October due to adjustments needed to manage the situation. read more AMIA's Cuevas forecast Mexican automotive exports would decline between 3.8% and 4.2% this year from 2020 and projected production to fall by between 4.7% and 5%, saying Mexico's auto industry would only return to pre-pandemic levels in 2024. A senior executive at Mexico's Automobile Distributors Association (AMDA) said analysts were forecasting that supply and demand for semiconductor chips would be in balance around the second quarter of 2022. Compounding carmakers' woes in Mexico have been 86 days of railroad blockades as of Oct. 5 in the western state of Michoacan, home to the key port of Lazaro Cardenas, according to analysis by Grupo Financiero BASE. Automakers in Brazil lowered projections for sales, output and exports this year, blaming a shortage of parts and a slow economic recovery. Anfavea, which represents global carmakers such as General Motors (GM.N), Volkswagen and Fiat (STLA.MI) in Brazil, now expects sales of new automobiles in Brazil to either fall by 1% or rise by no more than 3% this year. In July, the association had forecast 13% sales growth from 2020. Vehicle sales in Brazil fell 10.2% in September from August to 155,075 units, according to Anfavea. Still, automotive output in Brazil did rise 5.6% in September from August.

"Thursday, Oct 7th 2021 12AM 26°C 'It's easier for Boris to make a video stuffing his face with chips than solve problems ': Business fury as PM says it is 'not HIS job' to fix supply chain chaos and DISMISSES inflation fears - despite invoking Thatcher's 'no alternative' mantra Boris Johnson has been giving a series of interviews from the Conservative Party conference in Manchester   The PM blamed the wave of supply chain chaos on Covid and Britain changing from a 'low wage' economy He insisted the disruption was like a 'giant waking' up and 'creaking' after the pandemic stalled activity Mr Johnson said 'not the job of government to come in and fix every problem' amid fears of Christmas misery He admitted that just 127 foreign lorry drivers have applied for emergency visas under government scheme  By JAMES TAPSFIELD, POLITICAL EDITOR FOR MAILONLINE and MARK DUELL PUBLISHED: 07:52 BST, 5 October 2021 | UPDATED: 18:41 BST, 6 October 2021 How inflation threatens families and the public finances  Headline CPI inflation has been spiking, reaching 3.2 per cent in August, and is expected to reach double the Bank of England's 2 per cent target  With inflation set to peak above four per cent, this will likely cause the price of everyday goods – from food to fuel – to rise. Last year, the average household spent £277 a month on food expenses, but the latest inflation reading suggests this could increase to £285 a month this year. Price of a pint The average price of a pint in the pub across the country could soon pass £4, the ONS has said. In August this year – when the UK's headline CPI inflation rate hit 3.2 per cent - average petrol prices reached 134.6 pence a litre, making an average tank of unleaded petrol cost around £74. That price hike is compared with 113.1 pence a litre a year earlier, when travel was reduced due to the coronavirus lockdown restrictions. If inflation tips over the 4 per cent mark, the average price of a tank of fuel could hit £78, and that is without factoring in any supply chain pressures or global issues which make the cost rise further. How inflation has hit other countries Inflation has long been seen as one of the biggest threats to economies. In extreme examples, it has spiralled out of control and sparked panic. The German Weimar Republic effectively collapsed after the value of the mark went from around 90 marks to the US dollar in 1921 to 7,400 marks to the dollar in 1921. In Zimbabwe between 2008 and 2009 the monthly inflation rate was estimated to have reached a mind-boggling 79.6billion per cent. Although inflation has faded in the minds of Britons who have become used to ultra-low interest rates and stable prices, it caused chaos in the 1970s. Deregulation of the mortgage market, the emergence of credit cards and an overheating economy drove the rate to an eye-watering 25 per cent in 1975. People would rush to buy goods with their wages after pay-day, as the costs were rising so quickly. Strikes erupted as there was pressure for pay packets to keep pace with prices. Unemployment rose as the economy tipped into recession, and the government had to pump up interest rates in a bid to bolster the pound and control the surge. That meant mortgage interest payments spiked into double digits. And as a result servicing the national debt became a serious problem.  Furious business chiefs have accused Boris Johnson of 'buck-passing' after he defiantly dismissed fears over spiking inflation and supply chain chaos, saying it is not his job to fix all the problems. In a flurry of interviews ahead of his keynote speech to Tory conference today, the PM denied that the country is in 'crisis', comparing the disruption to a 'giant waking up' and 'creaking' after the pandemic.   Despite Cabinet ministers telling MailOnline they were concerned about 'complacency' over inflation, now on track to be double the Bank of England's target, Mr Johnson said he was not 'worried' about it running out of control. He also pushed responsibility back on the private sector, insisting it is 'not the job of government to come in and fix every problem'.  Referencing Margaret Thatcher's 1980s dictum - which ironically she used to stress the need to control inflation in a market economy - Mr Johnson said: 'In a famous phrase, there is no alternative. There is no alternative. 'The UK has got to - and we can - do much, much better by becoming a higher-wage, higher-productivity economy.' But he admitted that Christmas might only be better from a 'low base' amid fears of ongoing shortages - after it was effectively cancelled during the pandemic last year. And he conceded that the government's efforts to bring in more lorry drivers from abroad are having limited success, with just 127 having applied for emergency visas.   The uncompromising line from Mr Johnson came as new figures showed pump prices have hit 136.10p per litre, the highest level since September 2013.  Tensions were also inflamed further by Mr Johnson releasing a series of videos of him drinking beer, buttering toast and eating fish and chips to promote his 'Build Back Better' slogan.  Liz Barnes, managing director at Lewes-based wet wipes firm FreshWipes said: 'If he likes alliteration, Boris can shove his butter up his backside.' Others raged that Mr Johnson should be focused on solutions rather than 'stuffing his face with chips'.   Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has warned that firms will be to blame if the festive season is blighted by shortages and price rises. One Cabinet source told the Telegraph that companies have been 'drunk on cheap labour' and failed to plan for the changes.  But industry has warned of an estimated shortfall of 100,000 HGV drivers, with the threat of empty shelves if the shortages are not addressed. They said the government's visa offer is not 'attractive' enough to draw in the people they need immediately.  In other developments at the Tory conference builds towards the leaders' speech:  Mr Johnson has branded Insulate Britain protesters 'irresponsible crusties' as Priti Patel unveiled tougher measures to stop them blocking roads; The PM called for people to return to offices warning otherwise they will be 'gossiped' about and miss out on 'stimulus' and 'competition'; Mr Johnson clashed bitterly with the BBC's Nick Robinson in his first Today programme interview in two years; The premier refused to rule out calling an early election but insisted he is focused 'on the job at hand';  The number of offenders forced to wear electronic tags will double under a major initiative from Dominic Raab; The PM ruled out making misogyny a hate crime, saying there are 'abundant' existing laws that should be enforced to tackle violence against women; Civil servants still working from home were told to 'get off their Pelotons and back to their desks' today by Tory party chairman Oliver Dowden  Boris shares funny 'Build Back Better' slogans to Twitter Boris Johnson pictured writing his Conservative Party conference speech at the Midland Hotel in Manchester today  In a round of interviews at the Tory conference in Manchester, the PM insisted the country is at a 'turning point' as businesses are weaned off cheap labour after Brexit Mr Johnson tried out a bike as he toured stands at Tory conference in Manchester this morning  The premier also tried out a hydrogen car as he was shown around the stands at the conference centre today Boris Johnson compared the current disruption to a 'giant waking up', saying it was what you would expect of the global economy recovering and 'sucking in demand' Boris Johnson: It's not the governments job to 'fix all the problems' PM will tell Britain to get back to work: Boris Johnson to... Boris Johnson warns wfh Britons they risk being 'gossiped... Mr Johnson's broadcast round included his first interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programme in two years. Has Boris just had his 'Ratner moment'? When politicians and business leaders have said things they come to regret  Boris Johnson's comments today could come to be seen as his 'Ratner moment'. Here are six other famous gaffes by politicians and businessmen: • Gerald Ratner: The jewellery company boss jokingly referred to a set of decanters sold by the company as 'total c**p' during a speech in 1991, which almost led to the business collapsing. The share price tanked and the group had to restructure financially, with Mr Ratner resigning the following year. • Emily Thornberry: The Labour MP resigned from Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet in 2014 after tweeting a photo of a house in Kent draped in St George's flags with a white van outside, captioned: 'Image from Rochester.' She tried to rebuild her reputation and is now shadow international trade secretary. • Mike Coupe: The Sainsbury's boss sang 'We're in the Money' from the musical 42nd Street in 2018 while waiting to be interviewed by ITV to talk about the proposed Asda merger, but later apologised. The deal was blocked the following year, and he is now chairman of Oak Furnitureland. • Philip Green: The retail mogul apologised to the Irish to prevent a customer boycott after claiming in 2003 of the Guardian's then-financial editor Paul Murphy: 'He can't read English. Mind you, he is a f***ing Irishman.' His Arcadia group went into administration last year amid falling high street sales. • Freddy Shepherd and Douglas Hall: The Newcastle United chairman and vice-chairman called Newcastle women 'dogs' and implied fans were paying too much for replica shirts while being recorded in 1998. They both apologised and resigned two weeks later. Shepherd died in 2017. • Bill Clinton: The US president denied his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky in 1998, saying: 'I did not have sexual relations with that woman'. He was later impeached for lying about the matter under oath, but was acquitted at his Senate trial. And it quickly descended into acrimony, with presenter Nick Robinson demanding that the PM 'stop talking' as he blustered through responses to questions. A clearly stung Mr Johnson repeatedly referred to the rebuke, asking why he was there if he was not meant to be talking.  In another wave of interviews this afternoon, Mr Johnson said he is 'not worried' about staffing shortages and rising energy prices and dismissed concerns about rising inflation. He told BBC News in Manchester: 'We're moving to a new approach, and I do not want to go back to what I think is a tired old failed approach, which people voted against twice in 2016 and in 2019. 'Some of the people who would be writing to me, may be worried about this, but I'm not worried about this because, actually, I think it would be good for their businesses to invest in people.' Asked about inflation having the possibility to eat up wage rises, he said: 'Actually I think that people have been worried about inflation for a long time and it hasn't materialised.' Pressed if he is not worried about inflation, he said: 'I believe that supply will be encouraged, and we want to encourage people to invest in.' Mr Johnson told GB News: 'It's not the job of government to come in and try and fix every problem in business and industry. 'We have fantastic supply chains in this country, fantastic logistics, there is a problem of demand.' He said in the haulage industry has depended on low wage workers migrating to the UK to work under tough conditions. Mr Johnson said that just 127 of the 300 visas for tanker drivers to come to the UK immediately have been granted. 'What we said to the road haulage industry was: 'Fine, give us the names of the drivers that you want to bring in and we will sort out the visas, you've got another 5,000 visas',' he said. 'They only produced 127 names so far. What that shows is the global shortage.' The Department for Transport later clarified that of the 127 visas issued, 27 were for fuel tanker drivers and the remaining 100 were for food hauliers.  Speaking on BBC Breakfast, the premier said: 'The supply chain problem is caused very largely by the strength of the economic recovery. 'What you will see is brilliant logistic experts in our supermarket chains, in our food processing industry, getting to grips with it, finding the staff that they need, we will help them in any way that we can. 'But the shortage is global.' He went on: 'What you can't do is go back to the old, failed model where you mainline low-wage, low-skilled labour – very often very hard-working, brave, wonderful people – who come in, working in conditions that frankly are pretty tough and we shouldn't be going back to that.' That had led to a situation where there was not investment in the industry and 'people had to urinate in bushes' because of the lack of facilities for drivers, he said. Mr Johnson told LBC: 'I sympathise very much with the frustrations of people who have been queueing for petrol. I really, really do. 'I understand how infuriating it is when you can't get petrol at the pumps, but I must repeat that this has overwhelmingly been a problem of demand, not supply.' He added: 'What I am getting at is that the tanker drivers, the lorry drivers, they have got more than the average week's supply to the pumps for the last few days, and that is the situation.' Go to the office if you don't want to be 'gossiped' about, says PM  Boris Johnson today warned Britons working from home that they risk being 'gossiped about' and missing out on 'stimulus and competition' unless they return to the office.  The PM voiced growing confidence that Covid will not spark further lockdowns as he urged people to get 'back to work in the normal way'. He said the government was always 'humble in the face of nature' and recognised that 'a new variant or another pandemic could always hit us'. But he insisted: 'The data that I see at the moment is very clear that we are right to stick to Plan A, which is what we are on.' He said getting back to offices was 'essential for young people in particular'.  'If you are going to learn on the job, you can't just do it on Zoom,' he told LBC radio. 'You have got to be able to come in, you have got to know what everyone else is talking about – otherwise you are going to be gossiped about and you are going to lose out.'    He also said: 'I think even the Petrol Retailers Association have been saying that the situation has been improving markedly. 'What you are seeing is the UK economy coming back into life, really sort of stretching its legs, starting to move again, and of course there's been a bit of creaking here and there because we haven't had such activity in a long time.' Mr Johnson played down fears over spiralling inflation, saying the tackling underlying productivity problems was the way to 'fix' rising prices.  He said the market would address current demand-led shortages and the shift away from fossil fuels would have a long-term effect on energy bills. 'This Government is going to fix it for the long-term by making investments in renewable power that we can rely on in this country,' he said. Mr Johnson added: 'This Government is doing the difficult, long-term things. We got Brexit done, which was a very difficult thing to do, and we are now going to address the big, underlying issues that face the UK: long-term lack of productivity, long-term lack of investment in energy and infrastructure. 'We are going to fix that. 'That will have a big downward pressure on costs and that is the way to tackle inflation.' He also defended ending the £20 a week boost to Universal Credit, arguing the taxpayer should not subsidise low wages.  'I understand that people feel times are difficult at the moment because we have got an economy that's coming out of a very tough period with the Covid pandemic and it's growing strongly now,' he said. 'We've got the fastest economic growth in the G7.'   However, Mr Johnson's relaxed attitude on inflation is not shared by all his top team. One Cabinet minister told MailOnline the Bank of England is 'complacent' on inflation.  'They should be unwinding quantitative easing now, before acting on interest rates. They could try reducing it a back and gauge the reaction,' they said. 'It might push the pound up, but that is not a bad thing as the pound has been falling and it would help reduce inflation.' And there is increasing frustration from many sectors about his failure to step in.  PM refuses to rule out calling early election  Boris Johnson today refused to rule out an early general election in 2023 as he insisted he is 'focusing on the job in hand'.  The Prime Minister said that 'nobody is thinking about that right now frankly' and 'we want to get on with delivering'.  He repeatedly declined to commit to serving a full term, with the next election currently scheduled to take place in 2024.  There is growing speculation that Mr Johnson could go to the country earlier than planned.  The Government is in the process of repealing the Fixed-term Parliaments Act which was rolled out in 2011 and dictates that parliamentary terms last for up to five years.  The legislation, introduced by the Coalition Government, dictates that following the election in 2019, the next national poll will take place on Thursday May 2, 2024. The Conservative Party pledged in its most recent manifesto to get rid of the law, arguing that it should be up to the PM when elections are called.      Currently an election can only be triggered outside of the normal parliamentary cycle if two thirds of MPs vote in favour of one or if the Government loses a vote of no confidence.     As well as an estimated shortfall of 100,000 HGV drivers, businesses from meat producers to retailers have warned of empty shelves if the shortages are not addressed. The Road Haulage Association (RHA) disagreed with Mr Johnson's comments over the Government asking for names of European lorry drivers they want to work in the UK. Rod McKenzie, managing director of policy and public affairs at the RHA, said: 'There isn't a database of lorry drivers with names attached to them and want to work in Britain that British lorry firms can tap into and say: 'We'll have that one, that one, that one or that one'. It doesn't work like that, it doesn't exist.' He added: 'Why would you give up a well-paid job in Europe to come and drive a truck in Britain for a very short period of time when you have to get a six-month let on a flat and go through all the hassle, initially to be chucked out on Christmas Eve, but now, we're told, for a bit later? 'It is not an attractive offer and, effectively, what Europeans have done is kind of vote with their feet on that.' Rhys Schofield, managing director at Peak Mortgages and Protection in Belper, Derbyshire, said: 'A lovely bit of buck passing from the government. Whilst the government can't be expected to solve every problem, it is surely the government's responsibility to fix the problems that they create. 'A poorly implemented Brexit and general lack of any coherent plan in anything they do just makes life more difficult than it needs to be. 'It's easier to make a video stuffing your face with chips to distract the electorate than actually solve problems of your own making.' Ali Capper, executive chair of the trade body British Apples and Pears, who also runs a hop and fruit farm, said:  'Like all British apple and pear growers, staff are short this year. On our own farm we're running 10 to 15 per cent short of the numbers we need, but I am speaking to farms that are 30 or 40 per cent short of staff. 'It's a combination - Brexit, Covid… but really what we need are sensible policies put in place. We have the seasonal workers scheme for our sector. This year it's bringing 30,000 workers. There is no doubt that needs to be expanded, probably doubled, and we need the number of permanent operators increased as well.'  A spokesperson for the British Meat Processors Association said: 'The current supply chain issues are systemic and long term, but we have an immediate and worsening short-term labour crisis right now. 'The problem requires both short and long-term solutions in order to allow industry to adjust to the realities of the post-Brexit labour market, which were only made clear once the Brexit deal was finally signed at the end of January 2020.  'Such solutions were presented to the Government in October 2020 by the Migration Advisory Committee, however the Home Secretary, Priti Patel rejected all the recommendations. 'Contrary to recent claims, we are not asking for a return to free movement, nor are we asking Government to fix the problem for us.  'What we are actually calling for is a short-term pragmatic use of the UK's new-found immigration controls to plug workforce gaps immediately, while we work on the longer-term solution. 'Industry is already working hard on the longer-term solution with a combination of recruitment and investment in technology.  'As an example, one company alone has been investing around £100 million per year for the last five years on new technology and equipment, and this is being replicated across the industry. 'Regardless of how high wages rise and how many people join the industry now, a new recruit takes eighteen months to become a fully trained butcher.  'And we need approximately 12,000 trained butchers right now in October 2021. 'Government knows that the only practical way to plug the current gap in workers is to bring in fully trained migrant workers while UK workers are being recruited and trained-up.  'This is not free movement. It is an Australia-style controlled immigration policy to fix a short-term labour problem.' Mark Reynolds, chief executive of construction company Mace said: 'It's constantly a challenge (to get workers) and it's not helped through the effects of Brexit and the current fuel situation, getting people to work, is making things more difficult. 'I think we pay pretty well as a sector – the average salary for a construction professional in the UK is in excess £44,000 a year and in London is excess of £50,000. So I think the industry pays pretty well compared to most and has great opportunities.'  Gary Parsons, of HR consultancy Talk Staff, said: 'Great leaders take the blame and pass on the credit, not point the finger and ignore the support being asked for.  'SMEs account for 99.9 per cent of businesses in the UK and with the right support, government leadership and industry interventions they could be the answer to all of Boris Johnson's problems.'  As the Conservative gathering enters its final stages, Home Secretary Priti Patel will today announce plans to hit eco-warriors with a new type of Asbo in an attempt to halt their motorway protests. Justice Secretary Dominic has unveiled a deal to force criminals in 'chain gangs' to clear rubbish from waterways. Mr Johnson said Insulate Britain protesters are 'irresponsible crusties' who have been 'doing considerable damage to the economy'.  'There are some people who call those individuals legitimate protesters,' he said. 'They are not. I think they are irresponsible crusties who are basically trying to stop people going about their day's work and doing considerable damage to the economy. 'That is why we have taken the powers and why Priti Patel is doing the right thing to bring in powers so they can get six months or an unlimited fine.'  Ms Patel has confirmed plans for tougher powers against the likes of Insulate Britain and Extinction Rebellion in her conference speech. Protesters from Insulate Britain have blocked major roads including the M25 and the M4 in recent weeks. A court injunction was taken out to prevent their blockade of the M25, but demonstrations have continued, most recently on roads across London on Monday. Boris brands Insulate Britain protesters 'irresponsible crusties'  Boris Johnson has branded protesters who have blocked major UK roads as 'irresponsible crusties'. The PM said Insulate Britain protesters, who have blocked highways across the South East in recent weeks, have been 'doing considerable damage to the economy'. His comments come ahead of Home Secretary Priti Patel's speech to conference, in which she will lay out new measures to deal with demonstrators deemed to be disruptive.  Mr Johnson told LBC: 'There are some people who call those individuals legitimate protesters. 'They are not. I think they are irresponsible crusties who are basically trying to stop people going about their day's work and doing considerable damage to the economy. 'That is why we have taken the powers and why Priti Patel is doing the right thing to bring in powers so they can get six months or an unlimited fine.' The Home Secretary is expected to confirm plans for tougher powers against the likes of Insulate Britain and Extinction Rebellion in her conference speech.  A hearing on the original injunction, granted to National Highways on September 22, will take place at the High Court in central London later on Tuesday. Ms Patel announced an increase in the maximum penalties for disrupting a motorway, while also criminalising interference with major roads, railways and the press. The Home Office will also give the police and courts new powers to deal with the 'small minority of offenders' who are 'intent' on travelling around the country with the aim of 'causing disruption and misery across our communities'. Ms Patel has unveiled a £15million expansion in testing suspects for drugs on arrest, and is expected to say that 'unconscionable crimes and acts of violence against women and girls have no place in our society'. Mr Johnson is expected to use his Tory conference speech tomorrow to encourage a return to the workplace. 'He believes very strongly in the value of face-to-face working,' a senior source told the Daily Mail. 'It is critical for the training and development of young people. How can you learn a new job on Zoom?'  Mr Johnson launched an ill-fated attempt to get office staff back to their desks last year, which was wrecked by the emergence of the second wave of Covid. Scientific advisers have pressed him not to repeat the exercise this year because working from home is one of the most effective ways of slowing the spread of the virus. Instead the Government left it up to employers to encourage a 'gradual return to the workplace'. But a second Tory source said ministers were now hopeful they would not have to issue another work from home order this winter. 'You can never rule anything out with Covid,' the source said. 'But we are now in early October and hospitalisations are still running at manageable levels. 'We are not at the point of anyone thinking about Plan B. 'Even if we get to that point, it would start with things that cause relatively little disruption, such as mandatory masks and Covid certification.'  Mr Johnson climbed on a digger as he carried out his whistlestop tour of the conference stands this morning Government to invest £30m to ""make streets safer at night"" Dominic Raab has unveiled an initiative to double the number of offenders forced to wear electronic tags  What are the higher costs coming down the track for Britons over the coming years?  National insurance rise - from April  The rates of national insurance are due to be pushed up by 1.25 percentage points from April, in a move that will cost households hundreds of pounds.  The move will raise £12billion a year, which will initially go on bailing out the NHS and clearing backlogs after the pandemic. However, in the longer term it is meant to be used for social care. Boris Johnson has promised that no-one will pay more than £86,000 towards their care costs. However, that does not include accommodation and some other costs, with fears of a 'postcode lottery' as local authorities set different rules.   Initially the hike will look like a NI rise on pay slips, but later it will be billed a 'health and social care levy'.  Ministers insist it is fairer than other tax options because it falls on business as well as individuals. To raise the equivalent amount in income tax would require an increase in individuals' tax of 2 percentage points. A typical basic rate taxpayer earning £24,100 will contribute £180 in extra NI in 2022/23. A higher rate taxpayer earning £67,100 will contribute £715. For the first time, the NI will be charged on people working over the state pension age of 66. Universal credit - £20 uplift ends 6 October  The Government introduced a temporary £20 increase to universal credit payments in response to the pandemic in April last year, but the scheme is set to officially end on 6 October.  Close to six million people currently claim universal credit, almost double the three million before the pandemic, with almost 40 per cent of them classed as being in employment.  Thanks to the boost, a single person aged 25 or over has gone from earning £317.82 to £409.89 a month, a difference of £23 a week or £1,104.84 a year. In that case, the £23 a week boost made up more than a fifth of the amount they were paid.  Citizens Advice has warned that a third of people on universal credit will end up in debt when the uplift is removed, with the average shortfall set to be of around £50 a month.  Research by another charity, Turn2us, has found that over half of people on universal credit will struggle to pay their bills when the cut comes into effect, with a further one in four unable to afford their rent or mortgage payments.  'Due to the way Universal Credit is tapered as earnings increase, it's not just a case of people picking up an extra couple of hours of work to help fill the gap, instead they will likely have to make tough decisions about what to pay for and what to cut from the household costs,' notes Laura Suter, head of personal finance at AJ Bell. 'Anyone who will be hit by the cut should check they're getting all the benefits they're entitled too – Citizens Advice is a good first port of call for help navigating the system.'    Thomas Lawson, chief executive at Turn2us, said: 'The £20 per week cut to Universal Credit was already going to leave many families struggling to keep up with the cost of living.  'This, now combined with a sudden surge in energy prices, could spell disaster and plunge thousands more people into financial insecurity or even poverty; especially those of us whose financial resilience has been worn away by the pandemic.' Green revolution - coming years  Homeowners are set to be hit with a new environmental tax on gas as ministers try to force them to abandon the fuel in favour of green alternatives. Climate change levies currently added to domestic electricity, which average £159 per year, are expected to be axed and new payments added to gas to entice people to replace their central heating boilers and cookers. The move is intended to encourage the take up of heat pumps and other electric alternatives as they seek to make the UK net zero for carbon emissions by 2050. Ministers insist the change will mean no overall increase to bills and could help increase the take-up of electric cars as it become cheaper to charge them at home. However critics doubt that will be the case, and the change comes at a time when UK gas prices have hit a record high. Mr Johnson has also pledged to make all the UK's electricity supplies 'green' by 2030, although again the government argues this will cut prices for households rather than increase them.  Stamp duty holiday - already over The full stamp duty holiday came to an end in June, with the nil-rate band - the portion of a property purchase buyers don't need to pay stamp duty on - reduced from £500,000 to £250,000. The tax break, which saved buyers up to £15,000 on their house purchases up until then, was cut back, with the maximum saving currently capped at £2,500.  But from the 1 October, that went too, as the nil-rate band will revert to the normal £125,000. Stamp duty has been blamed for pushing house prices higher over the past year, with many experts anticipating a drop in demand, and hence prices, after its end.  And demand did indeed fall off a cliff between June and July, with the number of property transactions plummeting by 63 per cent, according to official figures from HMRC.  But many believe prices will hold up well in the coming months thanks to cheap mortgages and demand continuing to be driven by people looking to relocate to larger homes in the countryside in the wake of the pandemic. 'While there is likely to be a surge of property purchases pushed through before the deadline and a small drop in the month after, the early signs are that the property market isn't headed for a large crash – particularly while borrowing is still so extraordinarily cheap,' Suter said. VAT reduction - already over   The reduced VAT rate on food and soft drinks for hospitality businesses was introduced during the pandemic to help out struggling pubs and restaurants, and has been extended a couple of times.  However, it will now come to a close at the end of the month - and could see businesses hike prices to customers. On 30 September 2021 the current 5 per cent reduced rate will rise to 12.5 per cent, which will last until 31 March 2022, when it will rise back to the old standard rate of 20 per cent.    'Many hotels and restaurants decided to keep this reduction for themselves rather than pass it on to customers, to help shore up their finances post-pandemic,' said Suter. 'With food and energy costs rising it has provided a cushion for businesses and may have helped them put off increasing prices.  'But once the rate shoots back up it will be another squeeze on margins for businesses and means we'll probably see higher prices when going out to eat or booking a trip away.' Energy price cap - from October 1 On top of seeing much of Government support scrapped, many families and businesses are also facing rising energy bills thanks to the energy price cap.   Some 11 million households on their suppliers' default energy tariffs will see an increase of £139 a year to £1,277, while bills will also increase by £153 to £1,309 a year for 4 million pre-payment meter customers.   The increased bills will start from 1 October and last for the following six months until the cap is reviewed again. 'Usually you'd be far better off getting off your provider's standard variable tariff and locking in a fixed-rate deal, but the energy market is so barmy at the moment that no one is offering a fixed deal for a cheaper price than the energy cap,' Suter says. 'This means everyone needs to face up to rising energy bills, just as we head into the colder months. 'If your deal has ended you need to weigh up whether you want to secure a fixed-rate deal now, at a higher cost than your current price, with the expectation that you'll be protected from rising energy prices.  'Or you can stick with the energy price cap rate and gamble that recent gas price rises end soon.' Households struggling to pay their bills can also contact their supplier or ask for help from a debt advice charity.    Rising inflation and food costs Inflation fears were fuelled again this month, when the headline CPI rate recorded its largest jump ever in August to 3.2 per cent - with the Bank of England predicting it could soar above 4 per cent by the end of the year.  Contributing to the rise was a jump in the price of food and drinks, partly as a result of the supply chain crisis gripping the country. Food and non-alcoholic drink prices rose 1.1 per cent between July and August, and by 0.3 per cent over the year, according to the latest figures by the Office for National Statistics.  The average price of a pint in the pub across the country could soon pass £4, the ONS said.  Last year, the average household spent £277 a month on food expenses, but the latest inflation reading suggest this could increase to £285 a month this year, according to analysis by Royal London.  'Anyone who has been to the supermarket recently will have noticed that their weekly bill has been rising,' said Suter.  'A combination of shipping issues, driver shortages, supply chain issues and a leap in demand have all lead to a spike in prices – in July we saw the largest monthly rise in food costs.  'While you can't directly combat rising prices, you can reduce your food bill. There are lots of offers out there for using online grocery delivery services for the first time, which can get decent discounts on a shop.  'Or you can go back to the old fashioned methods of sticking to your list, meal planning and budgeting.'

Register for email alerts Gavekal: Chip shortage might not end 'until 2024 - or even later' By Richard Lander, Vincent Tsui 22 Sep, 2021 Citywire spoke to Gavekal Asia analyst Vincent Tsui about his recent note ‘The never-ending chip shortage’ (reproduced below). The deficit of supply is not going away any time soon. As Tsui says in the video interview above: ‘I think [the shortage might end] in 2023, 2024 – or even later.’ The never-ending chip shortage Nine months after the world’s carmakers began to complain about difficulties sourcing the silicon chips they need to make their automobiles, it is becoming clear these shortages are not just the result of short-lived disruptions. Sure, the pandemic has played havoc with global hardware supply chains. But Covid is worsening underlying shortcomings baked into the semiconductor manufacturing industry. This means there will be no early end to the problem, which will weigh on the export performance of East Asia’s manufacturing economies as they struggle to emerge from the Covid pandemic. Far from getting better, the problems afflicting the world’s automakers are getting worse. In mid-August, Toyota announced it will cut global production by 40% from September, while Ford and General Motors both extended the production downtime at their North American factories. The supply bottlenecks are not only troubling automakers. Much of the current shortages affect commodity chips, relatively unsophisticated gizmos needed for sensors, display units, power supply controllers and the like contained in a myriad of products. Yes, Tesla is having trouble sourcing chips for airbags and seat belts. But Whirlpool is also struggling to get hold of microcontrollers for its refrigerators and washing machines. Even blue-ribbon customers that long enjoyed first call on producers’ supplies are facing problems. Microsoft is short of chips for its Xbox game consoles. And in July, Apple chief executive Tim Cook said shortages of low-end chips are constraining sales of the company’s flagship smartphones and tablets. These shortages were not created by the pandemic, only revealed by it. For years, even as demand for low-end chips proliferated, suppliers had little incentive to invest in new, highly capital-intensive production facilities for commodity chips, given the slim margins they earn and the meager returns on capital they generate. However, existing bottlenecks in the supply of low-end chips are not the whole story. The enormous burden of the capital investments needed to compete at the technological frontier in the most advanced chips is also having an impact. In mid-August, Intel unveiled a new strategy that will see it outsource manufacturing of subcomponents known as ‘tiles’ or ‘chiplets’ to former rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC). This highlights the ‘winner takes all’ dynamic at the leading edge of chip development. With its vast scale and capital resources, TSMC is increasingly monopolizing production of the world’s most advanced chips. As other competitors fall by the wayside, they are outsourcing more of their production to the Taiwanese giant, which is devoting more of its capacity to meeting the demand at the very highest end of the market. This means fewer resources going into lower-margin products, which is where the bottlenecks are. The resulting chip shortages are going to ripple along Asia’s supply chains for years to come. Over the last 12 months, the impact has barely dented the region’s headline trade figures. Export values have captured new highs as producers have made the most of existing capacity and drawn-down inventories. But with exports having surpassed their pre-pandemic peak, from now on, chip shortages will be felt increasingly acutely.   This will cast a cloud over the outlook for Asian currencies, which over the last 12 months have performed strongly on the back of the region’s export recovery Now, exports face the risk of disappointment from a high base, even as the US Federal Reserve moves towards tapering and Asian central banks resist tightening.  The upshot is that investors should favor exposure to Taiwan as the biggest winner from chip shortages, and reduce exposure to Korea as a broader-based exporter, and therefore a relative loser from the continuing bottlenecks.
