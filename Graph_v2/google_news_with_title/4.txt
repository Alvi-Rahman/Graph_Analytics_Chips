Time to wrap up:
The petrol crisis has eased slightly today, with more forecourts in London and south-east England being restocked with fuel. Petrol retailers reported that the use of military drivers has helped, but warned that more help is needed to get supplies back to normal.
Members of the armed forces helped to tackle the crisis by driving fuel lorries, including restocking a petrol station in Waltham Abbey.

But petrol prices have hit an eight-year high, driven by rising crude oil prices, after more than a week of shortages at the pumps.
Brent crude has hit a new three-year high tonight over $83 per barrel, while gas prices have climbed to new records - driving up the UK‚Äôs cost of borrowing.
UK firms have hiked prices at a record pace last month, as they passed on increased energy costs and staff wages to their customers.
Service sector firms also reported that shortages of staff, raw materials and transport cost them business last month.
UK car sales tumbled to their lowest level for any September since 1998, with the shortage of semiconductors crimping demand. Van sales also fell, to their lowest since 2009.

Engineering group Melrose reported that its auto clients have been cancelling orders for parts, because they can‚Äôt get enough chips to build vehicles.
The supply chain crisis has also forced farmers to start culling healthy pigs, due to a lack of abattoir workers to butcher them.

Oil has continued to climb this evening, with Brent crude hitting $83/barrel for the first time in three years.
Victoria Scholar, Head of Investment, interactive investor, says:
‚ÄúThe decision by OPEC+ on Monday to stick to its plans to gradually increase output by 400,000 bpd in November until April has propelled oil prices sharply higher again today.
‚ÄúThe sharply bullish move, which has seen Brent rally to $83 and West Texas hit the highest since 2014, suggests that there is an imbalance in the market with demand outstripping supply.
‚ÄúAnalysts are now eyeing $85 as the next hurdle for Brent with a break above this resistance pointing to the potential for a move towards $90. Brent crude has rallied around 60% year-to-date, contributing to the broader surge in commodity prices, which has seen the Bloomberg Commodity Spot Index top its 2011 peak this week and log an all-time high.‚Äù

FTSE 100 closes higher
In the City, the blue-chip FTSE 100 index has closed 66 points higher at 7077, up almost 1% today.
Banks led the risers, with Barclays and Lloyds both up around 3.9%, as traders anticipated that interest rates will rise in the coming months (good for bank profitability) in response to rising inflation.
Commodities giant Glencore (+3.5%) was also in the risers, along with retailer JD Sports (+3.3%) which announced plans for a share split today.
Other European markets also rallied, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index jumping almost 1.2%, and there are gains on Wall Street after yesterday‚Äôs losses.
David Madden, market analyst at Equiti Capital, says inflation and growth worries are on the rise.
Stock markets in Europe and the US are in positive territory after a few days of losses. In recent sessions, traders have been preoccupied by fears of higher inflation, but today equities have rebounded. The gains made today are small when compared with the ground lost in the past week.
This time last month, the narrative was very different, because bond yields were relatively low, and inflation wasn‚Äôt a major concern. Now there is chatter of persistently high inflation, concerns about lower growth in China and the UK, as well as the possibility of the Fed tapering in early 2022. To an extent, the FTSE 100 has weathered the sell-off reasonably well since BP and Royal Dutch Shell have rallied because of the booming oil market.

Gas price surge drives UK borrowing costs to highest since 2019
The energy crunch has driven UK government borrowing costs to their highest level since May 2019.
British 10-year government bond yields have jumped to 1.09%, up from just over 1% last night, a larger move than for other government debt today.
Yields, which measure the interest rate on the debt, rise when bond prices fall.

British government bond yields have risen sharply in recent weeks on expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates early next year, to try to tame inflation.
With gas and petrol prices rising, and supply chain problems pushing up firms‚Äô costs and their prices, pressure is building on the Bank‚Äôs policymakers.

The UK government should be very worried about the surge in gas prices to fresh record highs, warns Javier Blas of Bloomberg:
Javier Blas
(@JavierBlas)
If I was the British government, I would be rather worried about this chart; very, very worried. UK natural gas has now breached the equivalent to $40 per million Btu barrier (~300 pence per therm). In oil terms, it's now trading above $230 per barrel of oil equivalent. pic.twitter.com/5hUnGASH8N

Javier Blas
(@JavierBlas)
And a reminder that during a supply crunch, natural gas prices go parabolic, reaching whatever price is needed to curtail demand. In Oklahoma last winter that price was $999 per million Btu. So some could say that actually current UK prices are cheap. #HockeyStickChart
October 5, 2021
And so should other governments:
Javier Blas
(@JavierBlas)
I said the UK government mostly as I call London home. But Brussels (and every other European capital) should be worried too. Continental European gas prices are the same, inflicting a massive inflationary shock on the economies. Industrial production will be curtailed.

Fuel shortages ease in London and South East as military deployed

The fuel shortages in London and south-east England have eased a little, after military drivers took to the wheels of fuel tankers.
Around 64% of fuel stations in the region worst hit by the crisis had both petrol and diesel available today, up from 62% on Monday, according to the daily survey of forecourts by the Petrol Retailers Association.
Just 15% were dry, an improvement on Monday‚Äôs 20%. Another 21% were offering either petrol or diesel, up from 18% yesterday.
‚ÄúToday‚Äôs figures show the situation is improving further around London and the Southeast,‚Äù said PRA executive director Gordon Balmer.
But Balmer points out that London and the South East are still lagging, and that there are still shortages in other parts of the country too:
‚ÄúWhilst there has been a significant reduction in dry sites, these areas are still lagging behind in having both grades of fuel available compared to the rest of the UK.
‚ÄúFuel supplies are increasing across the rest of the country: 86% of sites report having both grades of fuel thanks to steady deliveries and stabilising demand, 3% having only one grade and 11% are dry.
‚ÄúMembers are reporting they are now receiving deliveries from military drivers using commercial tankers, however further action must be taken to address the needs of disproportionately affected areas‚Äù.

IMF cuts global economic forecast as pandemic ‚Äòhobbles‚Äô growth
Larry Elliott
The head of the International Monetary Fund has warned the world economy remains ‚Äúhobbled‚Äù by the Covid-19 pandemic as she revealed her organisation has revised down its forecast for global growth this year.
Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF‚Äôs managing director, said the most serious obstacle to a full recovery was the vaccine divide between rich and poor nations and warned the global economy could suffer a cumulative $5.3tn loss over the next five years unless it was closed.
Speaking ahead of the IMF‚Äôs annual meeting next week, Georgieva called on rich countries to make good immediately on their pledges to share stockpiles of vaccines with developing countries.
Georgieva said:
‚ÄúWe face a global recovery that remains hobbled by the pandemic and its impact.
We are unable to walk forward properly ‚Äì it is like walking with stones in our shoes!
‚ÄúThe most immediate obstacle is the ‚Äògreat vaccination divide‚Äô ‚Äì too many countries with too little access to vaccines, leaving too many people unprotected from Covid.‚Äù

Hundreds of healthy pigs culled amid UK shortage of abattoir workers

The culling of healthy pigs has begun on British farms, with farmers forced to kill animals to make space and ensure the continued welfare of their livestock, amid an ongoing shortage of workers at slaughterhouses.
Pig farmers have been warning for several weeks that labour shortages at abattoirs have led to a backlog of as many as 120,000 pigs left stranded on farms long after they should have gone to slaughter.
About 600 pigs have been culled at farms across the country, according to Zoe Davies, the chief executive of the National Pigs Association, who said that culling had begun at a ‚Äúhandful‚Äù of farms.
‚ÄúWe have moved to stage two,‚Äù Davies said.
‚ÄúStage one was contingency planning and putting pigs in temporary accommodation. Stage two, we have not got any more space and pigs are growing, there are more on farm that we can manage.
‚ÄúYou either stop mating sows, which some farmers are doing, or you thin out pigs so the welfare of those on farm isn‚Äôt negatively impacted. We shouldn‚Äôt have to be here and we shouldn‚Äôt be doing this at all.‚Äù

The insurers Direct Line and Churchill have resumed offering cancellation cover to travel customers forced to cancel a holiday due to Covid-19.
As the pandemic gathered pace in March 2020, the travel insurers said they would no longer cover holidaymakers who were forced to cancel their trip if they contracted the virus, or the travel rules changed as a result of Covid.
On Tuesday, UK Insurance, the owner of the Direct Line and Churchill brands, reversed its decision and announced its policies would offer extensive Covid-related cancellation cover.
The move, which is an example of business returning to something approaching normal in the travel sector, is likely to be followed by the other big insurers.... More here:

Yellen: 'utterly essential' to lift debt ceiling
Over in the US, treasury secretary Janet Yellen has warned that America would fall into recession if Congress doesn‚Äôt agree to lift the debt ceiling.
Speaking to CNBC, Yellen says is it ‚Äúutterly essential‚Äù that the limit on government borrowing is raised by 18th October, when the government will run out of funds.
It would be catastrophic to not pay the government‚Äôs bills, Yellen explained:
It really undermines confidence in the full faith and credit of the United States, or willingness to stand behind our debts and make sure that we pay them.
It would hit 50 million seniors expecting social security checks, US troops‚Äô paychecks, and 30 million households waiting for child tax credits.
And it would undermine the reputation of US Treasury bills as the safest asset around, which underpins the dollar‚Äôs reserve currency status, said Yellen, adding:
I fully expect it would cause a recession as well.

The debt ceiling caps how much money the federal government can borrow, which only Congress has the power to raise or lower.
The US treasury has said it will be unable to pay its bills by around 18 October, unless Congress raises the current debt limit of $28.4tn. Failure could trigger the first US default in modern history.
President Joe Biden on Monday blasted Republicans for blocking efforts to raise or suspend the U.S. borrowing limit and avert a first-ever default on the national debt.
