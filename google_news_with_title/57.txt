Senate Bill Would Create Semiconductor Manufacturing Tax Credit
New legislation introduced by Sens. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, would create a 25 percent tax credit for investments in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing to boost domestic manufacturing of semiconductors and further the aims of a major push in Congress to stimulate domestic growth in that sector.
Introduction of the Facilitating American-Built Semiconductors (FABS) Act follows by the Senate earlier this month of the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act (USICA) of 2021, championed by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.
