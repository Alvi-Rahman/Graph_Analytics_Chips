  Ford CEO on F-150 Lightning: ‘we want to lead the electric revolution’

Ford (F) is starting to see some relief in the semiconductor shortage that has severely hurt vehicle production at automakers globally this year. 
CEO Jim Farley told Yahoo Finance Live the flow of semiconductors has begun to improve. Conditions in the third quarter have been better compared to the fourth quarter, Farley explained. Even still, Farley acknowledged the chip supply shortage will be an issue for the auto industry into 2022. 
At the moment, investors appear to be looking beyond the chip shortage. 
Shares of Ford popped 4% in pre-market trading Tuesday after the Detroit-based auto giant said late Monday it will partner with SK Innovation to invest $11.4 billion to construct two "mega-sites" — one in Tennessee and the other in Kentucky — that will build electric trucks and batteries. Ford's portion of the investment — $7 billion — is the largest manufacturing investment in the company's 118-year-old history.
Stanton, Tennessee will see the construction of Blue Oval City, which Ford says will aid in building an "expanded" electric-truck lineup. Currently, Ford has released the all-electric SUV called the Mach-E and soon will begin producing the all-electric F-150 Lightning. The 3,600-acre campus will cover nearly 6 square miles, at a total of $5.6 billion. It's expected to create 6,000 jobs.

No less impressive is the other mega-campus slated to open in Glendale, Kentucky. Dubbed BlueOvalSK Battery Park, it will be a dedicated battery manufacturing complex for Ford's expanding roster of electric vehicles. The 1,500-acre site will cost $5.8 billion to build and create 5,000 jobs. The location is targeted to open in 2025.
Farley told Yahoo Finance Live the investment is akin to planting a major flag in the ground in its efforts to lead the EV market.

U.S. Senate votes to confirm new consumer watchdog chief
The U.S. Senate voted on Thursday to confirm as chief consumer watchdog Rohit Chopra, widely praised by progressives for long defending Americans from predatory financial firms and students from insurmountable debt often incurred through deceptive private loans. Chopra, currently a Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission, is expected to begin next week as director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The agency will be key to President Joe Biden's administration as it tries to address social inequities underscored by the pandemic.

Today is your last chance to win a BMW Z4 M40i and a Miami dream home
Getting behind the wheels of a vintage Land Cruiser or Mercedes is a dream come true, but sometimes Omaze throws in something extra, like a trip to the Indy 500 or $20,000 cash. This time the extra add-on overshadows the car, a BMW Z4, quite a bit: a 6,060-square-foot, seven-bedroom, six-bathroom house in Miami. According to Omaze it comes complete with a swimming pool, double rainfall shower, a tub fit for a spa, vaulted ceilings, space for both a gym and office, and a custom kitchen that opens up to the outdoors, where you can cook poolside at your outdoor kitchen.

This is what both Suze Orman and Ramit Sethi say you should do if you’re worried about inflation
“The rate of inflation in the U.S. rose again in July and drove the increase over the past year to a 30-year high,” MarketWatch’s Jeffrey Bartash reported in August. For investors, that news was, no doubt, worrisome, so we looked at what two financial bigwigs, Suze Orman and Ramit Sethi, as well as other pros, have told investors in the past about dealing with inflation (psst: both say you need to keep investing in stocks.) Here (and below) are Bankrate’s list of featured investing products for September. Suze Orman: “Plan on many costs being double what they are today, and keep investing in stocks.”

Since the end of the Great Recession in 2009, growth stocks have rightly been the talk of Wall Street. A 2013 report from J.P. Morgan Asset Management showed that companies initiating and growing their payouts between 1972 and 2012 averaged an annual return of 9.5%. While it's clear that profitable, time-tested companies paying a dividend have delivered superior long-term returns, the question remains: Which dividend stocks to buy?

Why Atea Pharmaceutical Stock Is Ripping Higher Today
Shares of the mid-cap biopharma Atea Pharmaceutical (NASDAQ: AVIR) are up by a respectable 21.5% as of 11:44 a.m. EDT Friday morning. The biotech's shares are taking flight today in response to a successful interim analysis for Merck's oral COVID-19 pill, molnupiravir, in a late-stage trial. Atea, for its part, is also trialing an oral COVID-19 medication, known as AT-527, with a broadly similar mechanism of action (they both interfere with viral replication).

Why Is Nio Stock Dropping Despite Record Deliveries?
Shares of electric vehicle maker Nio (NYSE: NIO) rose 3% Friday morning before losing ground as the day progressed, trading down just about 0.5% as of 1:40 p.m. today. The weakness in the EV stock's price is surprising given that Nio reached a milestone and reported solid delivery numbers for September today, even topping its own projections. Nio delivered a record number of 10,628 vehicles in total in September, up 125.7% year over year.
