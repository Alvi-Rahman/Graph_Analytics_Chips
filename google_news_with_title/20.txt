Semiconductor stocks, such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ: AMD) and NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ: NXPI) took a hit on Tuesday, with supply chain fears moving the industry lower. 
Why Is It Moving? 
Shares of NXP Semiconductors traded lower again on Wednesday after Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon downgraded the stock from Outperform to Market Perform and lowered the price target from $245 to $230.
Rasgon noted the firm is "growing somewhat uncomfortable" with the stock's valuation and automotive end market. It is a "clear certainty that auto semis are 'over shipping auto production.'" 
Price Action: 
Shares of NXP Semiconductors were trading lower by nearly 3% on Wednesday. This brings the stock down more than 7% from its close of $216.69 on Monday. NXP Semiconductors lagged behind its competitors on Wednesday, with NVIDIA and AMD relatively flat.

Since the end of the Great Recession in 2009, growth stocks have rightly been the talk of Wall Street. A 2013 report from J.P. Morgan Asset Management showed that companies initiating and growing their payouts between 1972 and 2012 averaged an annual return of 9.5%. While it's clear that profitable, time-tested companies paying a dividend have delivered superior long-term returns, the question remains: Which dividend stocks to buy?

Insider Buying Could Indicate a Bottom in These 2 Stocks
Buying low and selling high may sound too basic to support a stock portfolio, but it has been and always will be a sure way to build profits. The only real trick to it – and it’s admittedly a tough trick to learn – is finding when a stock is at or near the bottom, to buy in. Plenty of stocks fall in price, that’s nothing new in the market. But most times, there’s a good reason, and it’s usually based in fundamental unsoundness. Successful investors will learn some way to sort this chaff from the

Why Is Nio Stock Dropping Despite Record Deliveries?
Shares of electric vehicle maker Nio (NYSE: NIO) rose 3% Friday morning before losing ground as the day progressed, trading down just about 0.5% as of 1:40 p.m. today. The weakness in the EV stock's price is surprising given that Nio reached a milestone and reported solid delivery numbers for September today, even topping its own projections. Nio delivered a record number of 10,628 vehicles in total in September, up 125.7% year over year.

Tesla vehicle deliveries hit another record in Q3, beats analysts' estimates
Tesla has weathered the chip crisis better than rivals, with its overall deliveries surging 20% in the July to September period from its previous record in the second quarter, marking the sixth consecutive quarter-on-quarter gains. In China, rising exports to Europe and the introduction of a cheaper Model Y helped boost Tesla's production, analysts said. Musk said Tesla suffered an extremely severe parts shortage earlier in the third quarter and had urged employees to make quarter-end delivery push, Reuters reported last month, citing an internal company email.
