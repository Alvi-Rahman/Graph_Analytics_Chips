 Semiconductor ETFs Soaring to New Heights

Semiconductor ETFs have been rallying this year and are hitting new peaks on several occasions. This is especially true as the pandemic has bolstered demand for chips in leaps and bounds, leading to the worst global shortage in many years.

Semiconductors have been the most important drivers of the overall growth in technology, given the use of chips in day-to-day life from cars, electronic gadgets to planes and weapons. The demand is likely to continue to trend higher given the increased digitization in various corners like healthcare, transport, financial systems, defense, agriculture and retail among others. The rapid adoption of cutting-edge technology like cloud, Internet of Things, autonomous cars, gaming, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies, 5G and other advanced information technologies should continue to fuel growth.

The global semiconductor market is expected to grow 12.5% year over year to reach $522 billion in 2021, according to the International Data Corporation. Per the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS), the worldwide semiconductor market is expected to surge 25% in 2021 following 6.8% growth in 2020. All major product categories will likely see increases with memory set to register the largest revenue growth of 37.1%, followed by 29.1% growth in the analog segment and 26.2% in logic (read: 4 Chip ETFs You Should Not Ignore).

Further, the semiconductor space has also been witnessing mergers and acquisitions, providing a boost to stock prices. Advanced Micro Devices AMD has agreed to buy field-programmable chipmaker Xilinx XLNX for $35 billion while Western Digital WDC is planning to merge with Japan’s Kioxia in a deal exceeding $20 billion. Nvidia NVDA is also in the process of acquiring UK-based chip designer Arm Ltd from Japan's SoftBank Group Corp for about $40 billion.

4 Companies That Could Be Worth $1 Trillion by 2035
Stocks with game-changing growth potential can grow exponentially in a matter of years, but among the many companies aggressively pursuing growth today, only a handful seem capable of making it through the stock gyrations and hitting the coveted $1 trillion market capitalization by 2035. To be able to get your hands on a potential trillion-dollar company early in the game is a dizzyingly tempting idea, though, so I dug deep into the hundreds of stocks with a market capitalization of more than $100 million to see which ones could go that far. Many use Visa (NYSE: V) cards, but few are aware of the kind of growth the company can enjoy in coming years.

Tax the rich? Democrats’ plans let billionaires off the hook
The House Ways and Means Committee outlined plans on Sept. 13, to move the top marginal income rate up a couple of notches to 39.6% and to introduce a 3% surtax on incomes above $5 million. Tax policy is deemed progressive if the chunk of income taken increases with the income of the individual – so wealthy Americans would pay a larger proportion of their income than poorer ones. With a regressive tax policy, lower earners pay a larger percentage of their earnings in tax than wealthier ones.
