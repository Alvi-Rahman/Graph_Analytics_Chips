Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:
3 Important Points from IDC Semiconductor Forecast and 4 Picks
There were three encouraging points in IDC's latest global semiconductor sales forecast for 2021.
First, the research firm now expects global semiconductor sales to grow 17.3% in 2021, on top of the 10.8% growth in 2020. The end markets driving this strength are mobile phones, notebooks, servers, automotive, smart home, gaming, wearables and Wi-Fi access points.
5G is clearly the main driver of semi revenues into the mobile phone market. So that segment is expected to grow 128%, with total mobile semiconductor revenues up 28.5%. And that's still stronger than X86 server chips, which will see revenue growth of 24.6%. Sales into the notebook market will be up 11.8% while game consoles, smart home, and wearable semis will grow a respective 34%, 20% and 21%. And automotive semiconductor revenues will increase 22.8%.
Which brings us to the second important takeaway. IDC expects the shortages in the auto market to be mitigated by year-end. We all know how crazy that has been. That has been a major factor holding back the sector, caught in between soaring demand and depleted inventory.
Overall, the firm sees front-end manufacturing beginning to meet consumption (which is healthy despite the COVID scare) in the third quarter as foundries step in to fill gaps, but cautions that back-end constraints and material shortages remain. The market is currently not expected to normalize until the middle of 2022 with the possibility of overcapacity by year-end as new fabs come online. Still, the semiconductor market will grow at a CAGR of 5.3% through 2025, which is a good bit stronger than the typical 3-4% growth historically.

Want $10,000 in Annual Dividend Income? Invest $114,000 in This Ultra-High-Yield Stock Trio
Since the end of the Great Recession in 2009, growth stocks have rightly been the talk of Wall Street. A 2013 report from J.P. Morgan Asset Management showed that companies initiating and growing their payouts between 1972 and 2012 averaged an annual return of 9.5%. While it's clear that profitable, time-tested companies paying a dividend have delivered superior long-term returns, the question remains: Which dividend stocks to buy?

Insider Buying Could Indicate a Bottom in These 2 Stocks
Buying low and selling high may sound too basic to support a stock portfolio, but it has been and always will be a sure way to build profits. The only real trick to it – and it’s admittedly a tough trick to learn – is finding when a stock is at or near the bottom, to buy in. Plenty of stocks fall in price, that’s nothing new in the market. But most times, there’s a good reason, and it’s usually based in fundamental unsoundness. Successful investors will learn some way to sort this chaff from the

Why Is Nio Stock Dropping Despite Record Deliveries?
Shares of electric vehicle maker Nio (NYSE: NIO) rose 3% Friday morning before losing ground as the day progressed, trading down just about 0.5% as of 1:40 p.m. today. The weakness in the EV stock's price is surprising given that Nio reached a milestone and reported solid delivery numbers for September today, even topping its own projections. Nio delivered a record number of 10,628 vehicles in total in September, up 125.7% year over year.

Merck COVID-19 pill success slams Moderna shares, shakes up healthcare sector
Merck shares jumped as much as 12.3% and hit their highest level since February 2020 after data showed the company's pill molnupiravir https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/mercks-covid-19-pill-cuts-risk-death-hospitalization-by-50-study-2021-10-01 could halve the chances of dying or being hospitalized for those most at risk of contracting severe COVID-19. At the same time, shares of vaccine makers such as Moderna Inc, Pfizer Inc and partner BioNTech SE were hit, with some analysts saying the promise of an oral drug that can be taken at home could change the public perception of risks associated with COVID-19. "We see modest perceived headwind to vaccine stocks such as MRNA (Moderna) if the market thinks people will be less afraid of COVID-19 and less inclined to get vaccines, if there is a simple pill that can treat COVID-19," Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said in a client note.
