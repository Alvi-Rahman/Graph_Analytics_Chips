Micron Technology Executive Vice President of Global Operations Manish Bhatia joins Yahoo Finance to discuss how the semiconductor industry has been affected by the supply shortage, the state of demand for products, and the effects of price increases.
Video Transcript
BRIAN CHEUNG: Welcome back to "Yahoo Finance Live." The big story at a macro level is the continued supply chain crunch for chip makers. And the largest US maker of memory chips, which is Micron Technology, reported estimate-beating earnings earlier this week. They did guide on the possibility of lower demand from a possible step down in PC customers. So let's get a picture of the complicated supply-demand dynamics in the chip space with the company itself with Manish Bhatia. He's Micron Technology's executive vice president of global operations. Thanks for joining us on the show this morning.
It's interesting because even the likes of Fed Chairman Jay Powell are paying attention to this. He's saying that chips are a big reason why inflation could be high. But he expects that to move down over the course of 2022. So just to start off there, is the outlook for the chip issues with supply and demand also expected, from your vantage point, to alleviate over that time frame?
MANISH BHATIA: Thanks, Brian, and thanks to all of you for having me back on. Yes, you're right, Brian. The unprecedented demand strength across multiple end markets, really synchronized right now as we've started to recover out of the pandemic, has created shortages across different components and parts of the semiconductor supply chain. And we are seeing that that is impacting some of the end market demand and pushing out some of that demand, particularly in the PC market.

TikTok's latest viral dance is for besties only
An audio clip created by an unknown user has sparked a new dance challenge. The "go best friend" sound is pretty much the hype man to any friendship. Now dancing TikTokers are using it as the perfect mood to go HAM with their BFFs. It's really the sound's lyrics that have made it a viral hit. The words are simple but to the point, "Go best friend, go best friend, f*** it up, aaah, f*** it up" . There are currently over 250,000 videos associated with the sound. Unlike most dance challenges there are no specific dance moves associated with the trend. Typically, a user just choreographs their own number and does it with a friend. TikToker @analisseworld danced in perfect unison with her bestie to the song. McKenzi Brooke used the sound to get her friend energized until she finally joined in on the fun

Gold investors have become super-bearish, which suggests a buying opportunity is at hand
The gold market performed well in the wake of past occasions when gold timers were as bearish as they have been this week. To appreciate just how extremely bearish the gold timers have become, consider the average recommended gold market exposure level among several dozen short-term gold timers my firm tracks on a daily basis. The last such occasion was at the end of this past March, at which point shares of gold-mining companies rose more than 20% over the subsequent two months (as measured by the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX) Please see the accompanying chart.
