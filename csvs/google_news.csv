China's Mandated Power Cuts Hit Local Semiconductor Sector
By Anton Shilov 3 days ago
But the impact seems to be limited.
Comments (1)
(Image credit: GlobalWafers)
As it turns out, mandated power cuts in several China provinces have so far caused more problems than initially anticipated. Apparently, ASE Technology and GlobalWafers were hit by the industrial blackouts. Chip test and packaging giant ASE Technology that serves pretty much every fabless chip designer, including AMD, has reportedly notified its clients that its production facility in Kunshan will be unable to operate through September 30 due to restrictions, reports DigiTimes. While TSMC and UMC are not affected by electricity supply cuts directly, their partners in the region are. GlobalWafers, a wafer supplier, was ordered to halt production, reports ComputerBase.
Local authorities in China's Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guangdong provinces do not cut electricity supply to foundries like TSMC, which makes some of the best CPUs for gaming, and UMC since they have continuous production cycles and cannot stop and then restart processing wafers without consequences. Therefore, for now, lithographic chip production in China will not be affected.
There is an issue though. Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guangdong provinces are production hubs that have their own supply chains, so if some companies cease operations, others will be affected too since they will not get the necessary supplies on time.
ASE's announcement caused the company's stock to drop 2.6%, reports FocusTaiwan. Meanwhile, the company did not make any announcements with the Taiwan Stock Exchange, so the impact on its business is not too significant. 
Being the world's largest outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) company, ASE has manufacturing facilities in various countries and regions, so ceasing operations in Suzhou will affect customers that are served by these plants. The company said that it was shipping products from the facility ahead of schedule late last week in a bid to minimize the impact of mandatory power cuts on its clients. Still, there could be some delays. A day or two production delay may not sound dramatic, but it will cause delays further down the supply chain, which could lead to serious issues with maritime or air freights. 
GlobalWafers also did not make any announcements with the TSE. It is unknown whether TSMC and UMC are going to miss any supplies from GlobalWafers or other companies in the region because of the power cuts. 
There are hundreds of companies in the three provinces affected by the country's decision to cut down energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Therefore, short-term effects on economy and local supply chains is something that is yet to be determined.
In the long term, companies will adjust to offset the effects of mandated temporary energy cuts on their businesses. Some will introduce night shifts at days when energy supply is unlimited while others will increase output in other regions.

Part of the reason for China's power outages is that the price of coal has doubled since the last time the CCP negotiated prices with private coal-fired power plants and those are now operating at a loss so their owners are limiting output to the minimum allowed until contracts expire to cut their losses.

It is estimated that...

The shortage of semiconductor chips has exposed the vulnerability of European high-tech manufacturers that rely heavily on chip imports from Asia. The automotive sector alone, traditionally a European high-tech stronghold, is expected to take a US$110 billion (£79 billion) hit over the coming years as a result.
In 2020, high-tech products represented approximately 20% of total exports from the European Union by value, with other major sectors including pharmaceuticals, telecoms, aerospace and armaments. Enjoying annual growth rates upward of 10% before the semiconductor shortage and employing more than 3.5 million workers, high-tech is the fastest growing European industry by far.
Considering the importance and apparent vulnerability of the sector, the EU is scrambling to implement initiatives to encourage domestic chip manufacturing and reboot innovation at home. After all, Europe accounted for about 44% of global semiconductor manufacturing in 1990, compared to only around 10% today. This slow decline was the result of manufacturers failing to adapt after domestic first-generation cellphone makers Nokia, Ericsson and Siemens were usurped by American and Asian competition.
Yet in the midst of this struggle for technological self-sufficiency, a European powerhouse in high-tech manufacturing was created by the acquitision of German LED (light-emitting diode) manufacturer Osram by Austrian sensor specialist AMS. The combined company is among Europe’s largest semiconductor firms and holds the largest market share in chips supplied to the automotive sector.
It is the latest in a series of mergers and takeovers in semiconductors that are representative of what has been happening in high-tech industries as a whole. Products which were once the exclusive domain of western manufacturers have become increasingly commodified as Asian manufacturers catch up, boosted by government subsidies that have left established companies struggling to compete. Yet at the same time, highly profitable and strategically important niche applications are emerging, which point to opportunities.
To understand why some companies have failed to adapt to a rapidly changing business environment, while others are driving innovation, it’s worth looking at the history of Osram in more detail.
Spotlight on Osram
Osram traces its roots back some 115 years to Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach, who greatly improved on Thomas Edison’s light-bulb designs with the use of a metal filament in 1906. Osram-branded bulbs started manufacturing the same year and went on to become the flagship product for one of the biggest lighting companies in the world. Osram later played a key role in the development other lighting technologies, including compact fluorescent light bulbs.
Some of Osram’s greatest hits in lighting, L to R: Von Welsbach’s gas mantle and early incandescent light bulb with an osmium filament; first high-frequency electrical ballast for compact fluorescent lamps; high-efficient blue LED with yellow phosphor for white-light generation; heart rate detection using efficient green LEDs in smart watches; quantum dots in LEDs. Wikimedia Commons, Michael Weinold. Adapted from patents: US409530A, US976528A, US4415839A, EP0118100A1, US7078732B1, US20200046275A1 and US10763400B2
Key to Osram’s survival over the years has been its ability to adapt by proactively seeking out new markets. Following the global effort to phase out incandescent lamps in the 2000s, Osram was well placed to capitalise. Scientists at Osram and the German Fraunhofer Institute had patented a white LED as early as 1996. This was only weeks after the Japanese researchers that would go on to win the 2014 Nobel Prize in physics for their ground-breaking invention, and Osram’s early start in LED research established its IP portfolio.
But when highly subsidised Chinese companies entered the market after 2010, LEDs for general illumination became increasingly ubiquitous and less profitable. Osram instead focused on developing market segments that demanded high-performance LEDs.
Backed by its in-house strength in research and development, fruitful university collaborations, and production capacity in the EU, Osram secured market leadership positions in niche applications like horticultural lighting for high-yield agriculture, infrared sensors for heart rate monitoring and lights and sensors for the automotive industry.

Osram stayed ahead of the competition by moving to niches where higher device performance and electrical efficiency were of paramount importance, rather than low manufacturing cost. The company’s product and IP portfolio today remains among the industry’s largest in key patent classes. And the takeover by AMS shouldn’t be seen as a sign of failure. It creates a global leader in high-tech optical solutions that has a much better chance of staying ahead of emerging Asian competition in these niche sectors.
Other western companies have not navigated the lighting sector as successfully. General Electric, a long-time competitor, had opted against developing its own LED research department, instead procuring chips from overseas manufacturers to include in its lamps. Faced with increasing economic pressure, and unable to fall back on more specialised products, the company that traces its roots back to Edison had little choice but to sell its lighting unit in 2020.
Lessons to learn
My department’s research has shown that maintaining in-house research capabilities and academic collaborations will be key to the survival of European high-tech companies in the near future. Governments can support these efforts of private industry by strengthening the academic landscape in Europe. This can be achieved through projects like the Horizon Europe Programme, which funds both basic university research and collaborative efforts with industry.
In the long run, the best way to ensure the resilience of Europe’s high-tech industries is to “backshore” manufacturing of these products to Europe. With Sino-US tensions only expected to mount in the coming years, this would largely decouple strategic industry sectors from economic sanctions and mitigate geopolitical risks. It would also reduce the risk of the IP theft in overseas manufacturing.
Two of Europe’s largest suppliers of semiconductor components have already moved a significant part of their production back to Europe: Infineon Technologies in Austria and Bosch in Germany. This was enabled by unprecedented levels of factory automation and advanced robotics that is known as the fourth industrial revolution. As the Osram experience shows, controlling the most important parts of your technology is often the secret to long-term survival.

At the same time, shares of vaccine makers such as Moderna Inc, Pfizer Inc and partner BioNTech SE were hit, with some analysts saying the promise of an oral drug that can be taken at home could change the public perception of risks associated with COVID-19. ""We see modest perceived headwind to vaccine stocks such as MRNA (Moderna) if the market thinks people will be less afraid of COVID-19 and less inclined to get vaccines, if there is a simple pill that can treat COVID-19,"" Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said in a client note.

Should I do that Roth IRA conversion before Congress bans them?
A reader has just written in urging me to take another look at Roth IRAs. This follows my previous column, in which I said I was wary of them, partly because I figured I’ll be paying a lower tax rate in retirement than I am while I’m working. “The tax rate is not the issue; it’s the amount of tax you will be paying,” he reminds me.

New semiconductor device possibilities using black phosphorous

Stress and strain, applied in just the right manner, can sometimes produce amazing results.
That is what researchers, led by a team at UC Berkeley's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, discovered about an emerging semiconductor material—black phosphorous (BP)—used to make two types of optoelectronic devices: light emitting diodes (LEDs) and photodetectors.
Under mechanical strain, BP can be induced to emit or detect infrared (IR) light in a range of desirable wavelengths—2.3 to 5.5 micrometers, which spans the short- to mid-wave IR—and to do so reversibly at room temperature, according to study authors Ali Javey, Lam Research Distinguished Chair in Semiconductor Processing and professor of electrical engineering, and postdoctoral fellow Hyungjin Kim. Javey is also a faculty senior scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
Their findings are significant not only for the ability to reach these wavelengths, Javey and Kim said, but to do so tunably and in one device. Current technology would require multiple bulky devices and differing semiconductor materials to achieve similar results.
They described their findings in Nature.
Javey and Kim said that the ability to use a broader range of the IR spectrum, tunable within one device, could help meet the growing demand for applications in optical communications, thermal imaging, health monitoring, spectroscopy, chemical sensing and more. To demonstrate this flexibility, the researchers used one of their new devices to detect multiple gases.

The Berkeley-led team found that using thin layers of BP in optoelectronic devices and subjecting them to varying degrees of strain results in reversibly tunable output wavelengths over an unexpectedly large range. The output wavelength of BP and other semiconductor materials is a property known as bandgap.
The spectral range over which an optoelectronic device can operate is largely determined by the bandgap of its semiconductor material. Different approaches can be used to achieve the desired operating wavelength for a given application. For example, alloys—materials of varying composition—and strain can be used to tune the bandgap. While these approaches are indeed effective, they result in devices with fixed operating wavelengths.
""In our work, we can actively change the bandgap of the black phosphorous such that a single photodetector or LED can change its operating wavelengths within, roughly, the two- to five- micrometer range,"" Kim said.
""We can go back and forth as many times as we want,"" Kim said of the reversibly tunable wavelengths of BP based devices. They exploit BP's ""magical"" properties, he said, specifically, its bandgap change under strain, which is much larger than those observed with conventional semiconductor materials.
""There is innovation in the device itself,"" Javey said, ""but the material that we are using, black phosphorus, also has inherently unique properties [bandgap and sensitivity to strain], and we're combining those two key characteristics.""
Black phosphorous is a two-dimensional material like graphene. In a process called exfoliation, researchers use Scotch tape to lift nanometer-thin layers of the material, which is then transferred to a flexible polymer substrate, in this case polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG).

""Because it's mechanically flexible, we can bend it to a desired radius and controllably apply strain to BP,"" Kim said. That is, bending becomes an effective knob to modulate the BP bandgap.
Indeed, due to its puckered lattice structure, Kim said, BP shows unique strain-dependent properties which, in addition to bandgap, include tunable van der Waals interaction and piezoelectricity. Strain can be applied to BP in a reversible manner due to its thin membrane nature, he said.
In one application, the researchers used a technique called non-dispersive IR gas sensing. Because each gas has its own absorption band—that is, the amount of light it absorbs at a specific wavelength—a tunable IR LED of sufficient output wavelength range could detect, for example, carbon dioxide expelled by human breathing. That's because the gas absorbs light at around 4.3 micrometers, within the 2.3 to 5.5 micrometer device range. Other gases detectible with tunable BP LEDs include methane and water.
An application for BP photodetectors could be thermal imaging. It could be used, for example, in night vision goggles to detect any exothermic heat source like human bodies. Such tunable photodetectors would be capable of selective thermal imaging over a range of IR wavelengths.
From the materials point of view, there is a lot of interest in identifying new semiconductors that are more efficient in this wavelength range, Javey said. ""That's when we started to look at black phosphorus because it was known already to have a bandgap that overlaps with the mid-wavelength IR. From there we looked at how we can build efficient devices like LEDs and photodetectors using this material. But what is new here is tunability—that you can actively tune the device with strain over a large wavelength range.""
Moving forward, Javey said, ""I think this device concept can be applied to other parts of the spectrum, perhaps even making devices that could operate in the visible regime. That could enable new types of displays, for example, if these concepts and materials can be incorporated in a manufacturable, scalable way, with miniaturized electromechanical devices.""

SEMICONDUCTORS AND ELECTRONICS RESEARCH UPDATE
New theory could help optimize defects in semiconductors
10 Sep 2021 Isabelle Dumé
Material optimization: Strain can be applied to overcome doping limitations in semiconductors. (Courtesy: B Huang)
A new universal theory and three basic rules for how defects in semiconductors behave in response to strain could lead to improvements in the electronic properties of a wide range of semiconducting materials. The work, which began with the discovery of a key physical quantity that describes how a semiconductor’s volume changes in the presence of impurities, could help researchers determine the “right” amount of strain to apply, and thus optimize the effects of these impurities.
Defect-induced volume changes
Most materials contain impurities, or dopants, that are either intentionally or unintentionally introduced into the system – for example, during the growth of a crystal. These impurities induce volume changes in their immediate vicinity, thus producing a strain in the material.
In the latest work, researchers led by Bing Huang of Beijing Normal University’s Department of Physics and the Beijing Computational Science Research Center demonstrate that the extent of these volume changes, Δ𝑉, depends on whether the defect is positively- or negatively-charged. More precisely, Huang and colleagues show that volume increases for more negatively-charged defects and decreases for more positively-charged ones; in other words, Δ𝑉 is positive when an electron is added to the defect site and negative when an electron is removed from it.
Three basic rules
To further understand (and therefore predict) the different strain-dependent doping behaviours of semiconductors, Huang and colleagues developed three basic rules to describe how strain affects the properties of semiconductor defects.
The first rule describes how a defect’s formation energy changes in response to strain. In a material under strain, the researchers found that the total energy difference between a neutral semiconductor and a negatively (or positively) charged semiconductor that accommodates extra electrons (or holes) in the material’s valence band will depend on the sign and size of Δ𝑉. This energy difference will either increase or decrease superlinearly as a function of the strain, and the rate at which it does so will be proportional to Δ𝑉. If Δ𝑉 is close to zero, the energy difference will be a parabolic function of strain.
The second rule describes how strain changes the Fermi energy level (a hypothetical energy level that has a 50% probability of containing an electron) when the defect charge state changes. According to this rule, a compressive strain will shift this transition energy level up, while a tensile strain will shift it down.

The third rule describes how strain changes the position of the “pinning” Fermi level. This is an intrinsic effect occurring in semiconductor systems in which the Fermi level is far from the electronic band edge. This effect can significantly limit the doping-induced electron and hole densities, and dramatically degrade the performance of devices like solar cells and transistors. Huang and colleagues’ third rule describes how compressive strain will shift the absolute pinning Fermi level up in energy and a tensile strain will shift it down in energy.
Together, Huang says that these rules could help researchers estimate the “right” strain to apply to a semiconductor to optimize the doping effect of impurities or defects. “We have known for some time that strain can be used to tune doping effects in semiconductors, but a fundamental and general theory to understand the diverse strain-induced changes of different point defects in semiconductors was lacking until now,” he tells Physics World.
Full details of the research are reported in Chinese Physics Letters.

FISHKILL, NEW YORK - JULY 20: IBM workers walk in an IBM 12-inch wafer chip fabricating plant July ... [+] GETTY IMAGES
It’s in the news: “Semiconductors are the new oil.” The cliché is suddenly everywhere – and probably because chips are suddenly in short supply. We took oil for granted until the shortages in the 70’s made it “strategic.” Now it’s happening with semiconductors. People are talking. Defense experts are worried. Wall Street has perked up. Consumers are feeling it. You can’t buy that new Lexus because they don’t have some five-dollar computer chip… The media are alert to the heightened level of viewer interest. Congress is drafting legislation to promote and subsidize chip manufacturing. The President is speaking about it. The Wall Street Journal is alarmed at this fresh eruption of “industrial policy” across the world
“Last month, the U.S. Senate voted for direct industry subsidies with little precedent: $52 billion for new semiconductor fabrication plants. The European Union has committed to nearly doubling its share of global semiconductor manufacturing capacity, to 20%. South Korea approved up to $65 billion in support for semiconductors, and Japan promised to match other countries’ semiconductor aid…”
There are geopolitical overtones – the Chip race is said to be a critical dimension of technological competition with China.  
The chips-as-oil cliché is true enough (as most clichés are); it just doesn’t go very deep. Which is understandable, because the “semiconductor industry” is extremely complex. It encompasses thousands of companies, pursuing many different technologies and business models. In the fabrication segment alone
PROMOTED
“There are more than 30 types of semiconductor product categories…any one of which may require up to 300 different raw material inputs…processed by more than 50 classes of highly engineered precision equipment…incorporating hundreds of technology subsystems…”
In fact, the “semiconductor industry” is really a misnomer. There is too much diversity to lump them all together, and talk about, say, the U.S. market share in semiconductors. It is more than just a basket of apples and oranges. To stretch the metaphor, we might say the industry includes businesses as diverse as apples and elephants, and it probably doesn’t make sense to combine them – except that they are all involved in driving, and are driven by, the digital economy.

A full mapping of this heterogenous industry will occupy a number of columns over the coming months, which we will pursue, hopefully in an organized fashion. Another aspect of the heightened attention that the industry is drawing today is the cluster of timely, high-quality, and comprehensive surveys and reports, most of which are publicly available, to support the development of initiatives. These columns will distill and interpret the data provided in some of these reports. 

The Economic Footprint of Semiconductors 
Start with some of the Really Big Numbers. To “motivate” the analysis, as they say. 
Since 1995, something like $4-5 trillion in global GDP has been directly linked to semiconductor design and production, and another $15 trillion is said to be “indirectly impacted”
In the next ten years, the industry will invest “about $3 trillion in R&D and capital expenditure globally”
The auto industry is projected to lose $210 billion in car sales this year due to chip shortages (which is approaching 10% of total auto industry revenue)
Intel, TSMC and Samsung – the top 3 companies in the business, the technology leaders in the crucial fabrication segment — have announced plans to invest around $300 billion in new manufacturing facilities on the next several years — which is more than the market value of the entire North American auto business 
Public funding for semiconductor development is hard to fully account for, and projections shift — but it will approach half a trillion dollars in the next five years (40% of that coming from China)
Total revenues for the chip industry are now more than $600 billion per year – and were growing at an annual rate of 29% year-over-year in June 2021
According to the Federal Reserve, the index of semiconductor production sales volume has increased by a factor of about 33 times since the year 2000 — and 900 times since 1992 
Federal Reserve Semiconductor Production Index 1992-2021 CHART BY AUTHOR
These numbers are enormous, but they only capture the direct financial footprint. The indirect impact of the semiconductor industry is of course much larger. The modern digital economy is powered by semiconductors. So, yes, it is our “oil.” 

The Industry Segments (First Cut)
The industry cannot really be understood unless we disarticulate the production process and the value chain. That will involve peeling down through several layers, and repeating that process several times, from multiple perspectives —such as by product type (processors, memory chips, analog chips, etc.), business model (design only, fabrication, assembly/test/packaging), customer type (smartphones, automobiles, etc.), and national affiliation. 
The first cut is to review some of the high-level metrics for the broadest industry categories, based on the gross characteristics of the business model and the position in the value chain. This process will expose a set of interesting facts about the industry that are not immediately apparent at the global level. 
We shall start with four basic segments:
Design: the first step in the creation of an integrated circuit, as with almost every manufactured product, is to design it — in this case, to design a circuit which will perform a certain function, usually involving a calculation of some sort; this process is carried out largely “in software” (all the other functions are much more about hardware)
Fabrication (Foundries): The fabrication process converts the design into a physical product, a “chip” – which involves manipulating and applying various raw materials (starting with ultra-pure silicon) to transfer the circuit design into its physical embodiment  
Assembly/Packaging/Test: The fab process usually results in a “wafer” that has been printed with several hundred individual integrated circuits, which must be cut apart, or diced, and then each IC is packaged in a suitable manner. As this step is often overlooked in rough industry surveys (for reasons that will become apparent in later installments), it is worth quoting the Wikipedia definition at length:
“A semiconductor package is a metal, plastic, glass, or ceramic casing containing one or more discrete semiconductor devices or integrated circuits. Individual components are fabricated on semiconductor wafers (commonly silicon) before being diced into die, tested, and packaged. The package provides a means for connecting it to the external environment, such as printed circuit board, via leads such as lands, balls, or pins; and protection against threats such as mechanical impact, chemical contamination, and light exposure. Additionally, it helps dissipate heat produced by the device, with or without the aid of a heat spreader.”  
Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment: Also often overlooked as a merely ancillary segment, this category refers to the capital equipment used by the other segments to perform and automate their functions. Again, due to recent developments, the critical importance of this segment is increasingly recognized. (For example, it was the embargo on the use of equipment in this category that truly closed the door on Huawei’s access to U.S. semiconductor technology.)  
Semiconductor Industry Structure CHART BY AUTHOR

As we shall see, the companies within these categories have developed in very different directions. They have come to stand for four typical and, today, usually distinct business models. Although a few companies still perform more than one of these functions, most have specialized in ways that place them entirely within one of these categories. 
One of the first deep dives we can take through the semiconductor ecosystem is to apply certain metrics to the “pure plays” for each of these categories. (There are important subcategories within these basic segments, so the exercise will repeat at lower levels.)   
Metric 1: Value-Added
The first metric – in some ways primordial, the most definitive, and also one of the most determinative of the results we shall see when we apply many of the other metrics to follow – is the percentage of end-product’s value that is added by each segment. In other words, if the microprocessor in your smartphone cost Apple $50, the question is: What portion of that $50 can be attributed to, or was captured by, the company that provided the Design of the chip? How much is attributable to the Foundry that fabricated the chip? How much the company that “packaged” it? And how much to the company that built the amazing and complex hardware that enabled the Designer, the Foundry and the Packager to carry out their functions? 
A study by the Boston Consulting Group and the Semiconductor Industry Association, published in April, 2021, offers an answer, shown here: 
Value-Added By Segment of the Semiconductor Industry CHART BY AUTHOR
Here then is the first important stylized Fact about semiconductors: The Design segment is dominant in terms of real value-creation. 
This basic fact will help explain many of the other facts that will come to light as we apply other metrics to these categories. It will also help us understand the larger economic and geopolitical characteristics of there industry.

US, European Union Pledge Joint Action On Technology Issues, Semiconductors, China
The high-level meetings were held as industries worldwide grapple with shortages of crucial semiconductors that are harming manufacturing, including of autos, and pushing prices higher.

Updated: September 30, 2021 5:01 am IST
The ministers met at a massive World War II-era munitions factory (File)
Pittsburgh, United States: US and EU officials on Wednesday pledged to join forces to deal with a host of technology and trade issues to secure semiconductor supplies and counter China's dominance.
The inaugural meeting of the Trade and Technology Council (TTC) laid out a lengthy to-do list, but perhaps the most significant achievement was the symbolic restoration of good relations after the damage suffered under the administration of former president Donald Trump.
""It's just a remarkable spirit of cooperation and collaboration, and a desire between the United States and European Union to work very, very closely together,"" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters.
But the summit also set its sights on forced labor, artificial intelligence, digital privacy and protecting human rights activists online, as well as monitoring foreign investment in key sectors and controlling exports of sensitive products.
The high-level meetings were held as industries worldwide grapple with shortages of crucial semiconductors that are harming manufacturing, including of autos, and pushing prices higher.
The TTC was born out of President Joe Biden's summit in Brussels in June, when he attempted to repair relations battered by Trump's aggressive actions against trade rivals and allies alike, as well as more recent missteps that have riled Brussels.
The biggest thorn in the relationship are the Trump-era tariffs on steel and aluminum shipped from Europe, which the Biden administration has suspended but not withdrawn.
That dispute loomed over the tech meeting but was not on the agenda, although officials have said recently that they are nearing a permanent solution.
The ministers met at a massive World War II-era munitions factory and later steel mill in Pittsburgh that has been converted into an advanced robotics research facility.
- Semiconductor supply -
The talks were led on the US side by Blinken, Trade Representative Katherine Tai and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, and on the European side by EU Executive Vice Presidents Margrethe Vestager and Valdis Dombrovskis.
They did not announce specific actions but mapped out key areas for 10 working groups to focus on before the next meeting, which likely will be next spring in Europe, according to a European source.
""We represent those largest economies, collectively,"" Blinken said after the meeting. ""When we're working together, we have a unique ability to help shape norms, the standards and rules that govern the way technology is used.""
Seeking to address the global shortage of vital computer chips, the officials pledged in their final communique to work together ""on the rebalancing of global supply chains in semiconductors, with a view to enhancing respective security of supply"" and production, including of the most advanced chips.
Demand for electronic devices of all kinds has exploded since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, as more people work, study and find entertainment at home.
Semiconductor manufacturers at times have had to temporarily close their factories due to Covid-19, leaving them struggling to meet global demand and hamstringing industries including automakers.
Raimondo has said the chip shortage is both an economic and a national security concern, and called for investments in domestic manufacturing in the European Union and United States.
- Containing China -
The lengthy communique does not mention China by name, but the world's second-largest economy is omnipresent throughout, notably in the frequent mentions of concerns posed by ""non-market economies.""
In addition to semiconductors, the sides are grappling with how to work together to counter what they view as China's unfair trade practices.
The Biden administration so far has continued Trump's strong line towards Beijing, keeping in place punitive duties on Chinese goods, while the European Union has taken a less confrontational stance.
The ministers pledged to work jointly and through reforms of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
""We stand together in continuing to protect our businesses, consumers, and workers from unfair trade practices, in particular those posed by non-market economies, that are undermining the world trading system,"" the statement said.
But it also highlighted the need to keep tabs on investments in sensitive areas -- something Washington did when it banned Huawei's participation in the US advanced 5G cellular network -- and control sensitive exports that could undermine national security.

  WASHINGTON, Sept 23 (Reuters) - The White House will discuss ways to overcome a semiconductor chip supply crisis that is cutting auto production around the world in a new round of meetings with major companies on Thursday. 
  Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and White House National Economic Council director will host companies including Detroit's Big Three automakers General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis as well as Apple, Daimler AG, GlobalFoundries, Micron, Microsoft , Samsung, TSMC and others including Intel Corp Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger. 
  The White House plans to release a voluntary request for information this week to get better information on the chips problem from industry and potential solutions to supply chain issues. 
  The administration is seeking comments within 45 days to get details about ""supply and demand, inventory, ordering and customer segments,"" a Biden administration official told reporters Wednesday. 
  ""We have other tools in the tool kit to survey firms and require information,"" the official said, saying they would first seek voluntary efforts. 
  Another official told reporters the Biden administration also plans to stand up a voluntary ""early alert system for COVID-19 related shutdowns to microelectronics manufacturing around the world,"" gathering information from U.S. embassies, impacted businesses and others. 
  The administration wants to ensure it is ""maximizing our technical and material assistance to these locations to keep key semiconductor manufacturing facilities and other important facilities up and running."" 
  Rising COVID-19 infections have slowed output at parts factories in Vietnam and Malaysia, compounding a global shortage of auto chips. 
  Last month, the economy minister for Taiwan, a major chip maker, said it was doing all it can to address the global shortage of semiconductors.

Purdue technology for downscaling transistors could advance semiconductor design
Purdue University engineer Tillmann Kubis has created CasFET, or cascade field effect transistor, technology. The key aspect is the superlattice perpendicular to the transistor’s transport direction, which allows for switchable cascade states. (Image provided by Tillmann Kubis)

WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – An innovation by Purdue University researchers could help the semiconductor industry design transistors that are smaller, use less power and switch from on to off at smaller applied voltages. As a result, the innovation could lead to better and more powerful central processing unit generations, which can compute more operations with less energy.
Tillmann Kubis is the Katherine Ngai Pesic & Silvaco Research Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering in Purdue's Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. He said it has become more difficult to meet the performance requirements of nanotransistors.
""They need a high enough ON-current and low enough OFF-current, with a small enough difference to switch between both,"" Kubis said. ""These challenges have significantly slowed the downscaling of transistors around the last eight years, making it increasingly difficult to introduce more powerful CPU generations.""
Kubis and James Charles, a senior research associate in the Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, have created CasFET, or cascade field effect transistor, technology. It introduces a new switching method to transistors, one that is like the effects observed in quantum cascade lasers.
""CasFET is a more general approach than transistor technology we had developed several years ago. It offers more flexibility in the choice of materials and voltage settings,"" Kubis said. ""In technical terms, CasFET does not require band-to-band tunneling. Because of this, semiconductor designers could be able to develop faster-switching and more energy-efficient transistors.""
Kubis and Charles continue to develop the first CasFET prototype.
""Once that is showing the performance goals, we will continue with defining a concrete CasFET prototype design,"" Kubis said.
Kubis disclosed the CasFET innovation to the Purdue Research Foundation Office of Technology Commercialization, which has applied for patent protection from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. It is available for further commercialization by contacting Dipak Narula, assistant director of business development.

In our coverage of the semiconductor space, we typically think of two main vectors of hardware – the CPU and the GPU. Beyond that, we look at FPGAs, microcontrollers, and this decade is bringing the advent of the dedicated AI processor. What ties all of these products together is actually the FPGA - a field programmable gate array that allows a skilled technician to essentially build a custom circuit out of configurable gates. This means an FPGA can be used to design and simulate a full CPU or GPU, but also an FPGA offers a reconfigurable way to offer optimized compute power that adapts to the needs of its users without the cost of millions or tens of millions to design dedicated silicon. One of the first FPGA companies on the market was Lattice Semiconductor, which now focuses on small power efficient FPGA designs that end up in everything from consumer devices to servers.
We’ve been loosely following Lattice for a number of years, however three years ago the company went through a bit of a change. It hired Jim Anderson, the then AMD SVP of Computing and Graphics who had overseen the launch of Ryzen, the brand of processors that has re-energized the company from near bankruptcy to a number of years of extended market share growth and profitability. Jim and I met frequently at AMD events and we spoke at depth at the state of the consumer product landscape as well as how the semiconductor space was evolving. When it was announced he took the role of CEO at Lattice, I was a little taken aback, but glad that he had found a new challenge the complemented his background in semiconductor design and expertise.
Over those three years at Lattice, Jim has initiated a cultural shift that is playing out in the company roadmaps – new products, a more agile approach, and a need to focus on enabling machine learning at every part of its product stack. The recent financial disclosures at Lattice show an increasing demand for its hardware, as well as the company making strides to double its addressable market over the next five years. I thought this would be a good time to reconnect with Jim to find out exactly what he’s doing at Lattice to earmark the next generation of growth at this foundational FPGA company.

Jim Anderson
CEO, Lattice Semiconductor
Dr. Ian Cutress
AnandTech
From a career standpoint, Jim has a lot of experience. Academically he holds a MS in EE and CS from MIT and an MBA from MIT, and in his career he spent 8 years at Intel as a CPU architect on Xeon and Itanium along with strategic planning, 8 years at LSI in strategic planning and marketing of network components, a year at Axxia/Intel as the GM of Networking, and then 3 years at AMD leading up Ryzen. Now he is three years into the role of CEO at Lattice.
  Ian Cutress: You’ve now been CEO of Lattice for three years, and coming from the position of SVP of AMD’s Computing and Graphics business group, what made you make the jump from consumer hardware to power-efficient FPGAs?
Jim Anderson: Well I loved it at AMD. I was super happy there - I love the people at AMD. Great people, really innovative, very determined. I'm a product guy - I always have passion about the product, and in particular that product we were launching that day back in Italy, I was always super excited about. I love the products.
But when Lattice reached out to me, it was kind of hard to pass up the opportunity, because Lattice is a company that's one of the original founding FPGA companies from the early 80s. It's a company that's been around for about 40 years, it's got a great history of innovation, and it’s kind of a unique place that innovates and innovates around small and really power efficient FPGAs. Those devices go into all sorts of applications across many different markets. It is a great company. I felt like if I joined Lattice that I could help it get on a stronger path moving forward, help it build better products, and build products more quickly.
So that's kind of what attracted me to Lattice and the last three years have been a lot of fun. We've completely rebuilt the product line at Lattice, we're on a great trajectory, and actually, I'm even more excited about the years to come. We have some really great products on the roadmap.
  IC: Most users who know about Lattice understand that it's an FPGA company, but when most of us speak about FPGAs, we refer to the big names in the industry: Xilinx and Altera (which is now part of Intel). Can you talk about how Lattice positions itself in the market compared to the big names, and why that matters?
JA: Yeah, absolutely. First of all let me point out that if you look at unit volume size, actually Lattice is the highest unit volume manufacturer of FPGAs. We're the biggest by unit volume. Where we specialize is in small size, power efficient, and very, very easy to use FPGAs. Because they're really power efficient, and they're small size, they can go into all sorts of different applications that really large FPGA just can't go in. So either from a physical space constraint or a power constraint, our devices can reach all sorts of applications that our competitors can't, and so you'll find us in industrial, all sorts of industrial IoT applications, industrial automation, or robotics. You'll find us in communications, computing, consumer devices, and automotive electronics as well. So we really specialise in the small power efficient part of the market.
Those two competitors that you mentioned, which are traditional competitors, they really focus on the very large, very high power, complex FPGAs. We focus on the small size and power efficient. You would be amazed at the number of applications we go into. Whenever I meet with a new customer, I'm always amazed at some of the new innovative crazy applications they're using our chips in.
To give you a sense of the size, this is one of our smallest FPGAs on the end of tweezers here.
I'm showing it on the end of the tweezers, and this is about 1.4 millimeters square. Obviously we make some bigger devices as well, but devices this size can go into applications that other chips can’t, where there are either size or power constraints.
Since you mentioned the last time we met three years ago, if we compare our FPGA to this Threadripper chip from AMD, [this is what it looks like].
So I've now moved to the total other end of the spectrum! So myself and the Lattice team are really innovating at the other end of the spectrum: small, power efficient, easy to use, and like I said, important to lots of different applications.
IC: Your PR team sent a strip of those tiny FPGAs to me. When I opened it, I wondered what they were! I couldn’t see them - I asked myself why have they sent me a bit of plastic? I had to get the zoom macro on my smartphone to kind of see them, and even then I still can't read what's printed on it.
JA: When I first started looking more closely at Lattice before I joined, that was one of the things that I found really fascinating. I spent a lot of my career working at the other end of the spectrum on big high performance CPUs and things like that, so to work at the other end of the spectrum on the smaller size, power efficient FPGAs I thought was pretty fascinating. Well, I'm glad you got the samples!
  These @latticesemi FPGAs that just arrived in the mail are smaller than 1mm x 1mm. I can hardly see them without a magnifying glass of some sort.

— 𝐷𝑟. 𝐼𝑎𝑛 𝐶𝑢𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑠 (@IanCutress) July 28, 2021
    IC: You've been CEO at Lattice for three years now, and I think most of our audience may recognize you from the three years you spent at AMD in charge of the client division as Ryzen was first launched. I've looked through your history and you've got experience as a CPU architect at Intel, strategic planning and marketing on networking silicon for LSI, and your academic background is a Masters in EE from MIT. What ends up drawing you from architecture, to planning, to networking, to processors and graphics, and now to Lattice?
JA: The way that you said that, it makes it sound like I can't hold down a job, right?! [laughs]
I would say the common thread through my career is always that I've worked in the semiconductor industry - but you're right, and I've worked in a number of different functions. I started as a CPU architect at Intel working on Xeon and Itanium chips. But I’ve worked on multicore DSP chips, really complicated network processors used in communications, lots of ASICs, CPUs for client devices, graphics, and now FPGAs. So the common thread is always within the semiconductor industry. I think that, for me, the semi industry is really exciting, because it's basically the foundational layer of the entire tech industry. It is the fundamental substrate of the rest of the industry and it's pervasive in our lives. Anytime you touch an electronic device, you're touching the semiconductor industry in some way. So I'm just fascinated by the whole spectrum of devices built in the semi industry, and so now the opportunity to work on FPGAs at Lattice. The semi industry is great, and I like all parts of it.
  IC: Every time I seem to mention FPGAs in my work, comments always arise as to 'why not just build an ASIC?'. Can you explain why Lattice's customers, or anyone that uses an FPGA, chooses to do so over dedicated hardware or a software solution?
JA: There are both technical reasons and there are also economic reasons.
On the technical side, a lot of times our customers are trying to innovate on their system designs. They're trying to figure out how they can add new features or new capabilities that differentiate them in the marketplace. A lot of times [the solution is] an FPGA, which is incredibly customizable and adaptable. It can be a key part of the system that allows the customer to really customize and adapt their system. Then one of the benefits of the FPGA is not just that you can customize it for exactly what you need, versus say a standard product, but you can reprogram it over the lifetime of the system. So let's say, as your market changes or as you want to incorporate new features, [it can be updated]. Actually, we have a lot of customers that run artificial intelligence algorithms on our FPGAs. Those algorithms are constantly evolving, and so the fact that they could just reprogram the FPGA as the evolution of the AI algorithm changes, that's a big benefit. It provides future proofing for the platform, and so that's a big reason why customers design in FPGAs.
Another reason [to use an FPGA] that you mentioned is ASICs, or rather the difficulty in scaling them. If you're going to build a truly custom chip for your application, that takes 18 to 24 months minimum to go build that chip, right? From the initial architectural concept, to when you have something that's production ready. Your needs could have easily changed over those two years that it takes to develop that chip - whereas with an FPGA, you customise it right away for exactly what you need. If the needs change over those one to two years, no problem - you just reprogram the thing. Our chips are really power efficient and size optimized. A lot of times there's not a big advantage to a custom chip, in terms of power or cost.
Then kind of on the economic side, look at the expense of doing a fully custom chip today. You know that expense has escalated incredibly over the last 20+ years I've been in the industry. It used to be inexpensive to create your own custom chip, you know – it is way more expensive now, both in terms of development effort, mask costs, etc. So it's really seldom that it actually makes economic sense, especially with the type of FPGAs we have, and the cost points that we can hit, that there's really no economic benefit as well.
So for all those reasons, if you look at the history of the FPGA industry, it's grown as fast as the semiconductor industry in total, or actually faster in many years and in many cases. So that's why you see, over the past 40 years, FPGAs have continued to grow, and that the market is very healthy as customers continue to adopt that and in all sorts of applications.
  IC: Where can most end-users expect to find a Lattice-based product in their lives today?
JA: I think if you're using any electronic device, [you’re probably interacting] with a Lattice device somehow during your daily life, either directly, or maybe indirectly. For instance, a data centre or some of the industrial stuff that we do, for instance, in servers. Now, if you look in servers, either enterprise class servers or servers that are in big hyperscale data centres, obviously end users are accessing data and data centres such as big hyperscale data centres all the time. In those you would find a Lattice chip. In almost every new server today, way over 80% of servers have at least one Lattice chip, if not more. Those chips are doing control management of the platform and security as well.
You're now starting to find Lattice FPGAs in client computing devices, where we're providing a number of kinds of new functionalities. Also in communications infrastructure, so either wireline or wireless infrastructure like the 5G infrastructure, lots of devices use Lattice. Then all sorts of consumer electronics, high-end audio systems, home automation systems, automotive electronics - I'm trying to make sure I run through the whole list here! But I think that gives you a sense of it all.
Ultimately we have over 9000 customers, and if you look over the last four years, we've shipped about a billion devices. If you think about that, about a billion lattice chips in all sorts of applications, you’ll find us all over the place.
  IC: When I spoke to Esam Elashmawi a few weeks ago, he explained to me that Lattice is having an ever present increase in the server market, having silicon in around 20% of servers a few years back to around 80% today. When I review the hardware, I’ve always noticed the Lattice logo there, but I didn't realize how expansive Lattice's growth in that market has been. Why exactly are we seeing Lattice silicon becoming a vital part of the enterprise motherboard market?
JA: Yeah, great question! It's definitely been a big growth area for us. Our position in servers has grown considerably over the last few years, and we expect it to continue to grow. As Elam said, if you go back two or three years, about 20% of servers shipped with a Lattice piece of silicon. A few years ago they were doing more basic tasks, sort of power management or basic control functions on the server platform. Now, if you zoom forward to today, over 80% of servers today in the latest generation that's in volume, all ship with at least one piece of Lattice silicon doing more control and management of the server platform. Moving forward, we're doing more security functionality as well.
It used to be that, years ago, people were just worried about security more at the software layer. But now, there's concern of security all the way down to the hardware platform. So we have specific Lattice devices that are designed to provide what's called platform security or platform resilience. So what our devices do is they go to and check to make sure for instance, as your servers booting up, that the hardware itself hasn't been corrupted, or also the firmware hasn't been corrupted. So it will look at the firmware version before the system starts up, verify that it's the correct firmware version, and that nobody's corrupted or loaded the wrong piece of firmware. Then if it detects a wrong piece of firmware, because we have a golden copy stored within the solid state memory within the Lattice chip, it will actually swap and repair that firmware. That's just one example of the kind of new capabilities that we're bringing to a server. But if you look at today's servers, over 80% ship with Lattice silicon.
In the next generation that's just starting to ramp, our attach rate will actually start to exceed 1x, meaning that on average server platforms will have multiple Lattice chips used. So when that happens we'll actually be shipping more chips into the server market than the total number of servers that are shipped! Also, our ASPs (average selling price) continues to grow upwards, because we continue to bring more value to each server generation. So this has been a great growth area for us. Based on the multi-generational discussions we're having with our customers, we expect it to continue to be a good growth area.
By the way, I should mention, because I figured you might ask based on my history, is that we are CPU agnostic. Lattice supports both Intel and AMD platforms, and in fact, we support ARM based servers today. That's actually an advantage for our customers, and that's important that we're able to service all architectures, so we're totally agnostic.
  IC: I was going to ask then - do you make very specific versions of your FPGAs for AMD, for Intel, or even for Ampere? Or do they just take the ones off the shelf and optimize it how they want?
JA: That's exactly right, [the can take the ones off the shelf] and that's the beauty of it. That one FPGA design can then be customized by server OEM or even each server customer, because they want it to have their unique value addition. Our server customers are putting their own custom customization into the FPGA, and that helps them customize or differentiate their platform, but the beauty is that we can use a single device to service that.
  IC: One of the things I keep noticing on Lattice financial calls is a mention of a culture shift internally around the 2018 timeframe, which just happens to be about the time you took the role of CEO! Can you explain what was in place at that time, and how you've adjusted Lattice to be to what looks like path to sustained growth / what that sort of culture shift looks like? I think you alluded to aligning the product roadmap, but does it go beyond that?
JA: I think it goes beyond that. I think there has been a pretty significant cultural change at Lattice over the last few years. When I joined in September of 2018, shortly after that, I brought on a new leadership team. We went and recruited for all the kind of key functions like engineering, sales, marketing, and supply chain. [We recruited] deep industry veterans, people that have been in the FPGA industry not just for a few years, but for decades and have multiple decades of experience. So we rebuilt the leadership team with industry experts, and then we did make a pretty big cultural shift at the company.
I will say there were a couple of cultural attributes that Lattice has always had, that we definitely have encouraged and we've maintained. For example, Lattice has always been very customer centric, and in fact if you ask our customers they'll tell you one of the reasons they love working with Lattice is because we've always been attuned to our customers. So we're definitely continuing to encourage that, but also Lattice is a really collaborative place. We collaborative internally, and the groups work really well together, but we also collaborate really well with our customers.
We're encouraging those cultural attributes, but we did encourage or bring some new attributes - one of them is around speed and agility, which I feel like in the tech industry is really important. It can become a really important competitive advantage. I think that speed and agility matter a lot more than the size of the company, or [compared to] the size of the resources. I think the ability to go fast, get products to market fast, and to adapt quickly is absolutely a competitive advantage.
That's something we've really encouraged since day one, since I've joined. I think you can see that play out in our product roadmap - if you look at the number of new products we brought out over the last two years versus previous Lattice history, we've tripled the rate of new products that we're bringing to market. Our cadence is three times faster than it used to be. That's great for our customers - they love it because they've got new and fresh products coming out all the time from Lattice. So I think that's a marker of that cultural shift towards more speed and agility.
Then the other one I would say that we really encouraged was innovation. We always say innovation, and everybody says that, but I would say it's about being bold about the innovative steps that you’re willing to take. We are being much more bold about the future innovation that we're driving. So I think that's something we've really been encouraging the team to do - be much more bold in terms of their thoughts about where we drive the technology and the product roadmap.
The cultural shift has been a big part of it when I think about the progress that we’ve made. But the other piece that I would say, that we sort of mentioned early on like I said, is that you know I'm a product guy. At the end of the day our customers, the one thing they care most about is our products. So right away, in the first six months after I joined, we totally rebuilt the product roadmap and rebuilt it for not just the next year or two, but the next 5+ years. It’s completely rebuilt, really jacked up where we were headed in terms of the performance and the capabilities and the features. We're now really starting to see the benefits of that in this year, and in the years to come.
IC: I did want to talk about product roadmaps because you've kind of been slowly announcing how you've realigned your products over the last few months. Going from one or two products a year, a very linear cadence, there are now multiple derivatives in a parallel design flow. You've also said this helps double the potential addressable markets from $3 billion to $6 billion. Aside from just raw revenue dollars, what's the goal here? How does an FPGA company innovate? Is it more about explicit customer demand, or is it more pathfinding?
JA: It's always customer centric, our innovation. We always say this inside of Lattice - our innovation is always customer centric and market application centric. All the innovation that we're doing is to try to solve a customer problem or enable a new application - that's really what our innovation is directed to. We did make a big change over the last two to three years in how we do that innovation. From a product roadmap perspective, we used to be very serial in how we build products. We would build one product with one architecture, and then the next product would have a new architecture. We were very sequential.
What we've done now is take a platform approach, both from the hardware and the software perspective, and design each FPGA platform from the very beginning with the mind that we would build multiple derivatives. We would also be building versions of that FPGA platform that were say optimized around particular applications or customer needs.
So that platform approach has allowed us to dramatically speed up the number of new products that we can bring to market, and then it has allowed us to do new products that are more optimized for particular applications. One example of that would be security. We’re now developing FPGAs that are optimized for doing platform security. The other examples would be FPGAs that are more optimized for doing artificial intelligence processing at the edge of the network - inference processing in edge applications. So that platform approach has helped us to increase the number of products, but also helped us really tune our products for particular applications, especially the really big growth applications, or the applications that meet the needs of our big customers.
IC: Does optimization in that sense always mean taking some of the logic gates away and building, say, a hardened crypto accelerator, or a hardened AI accelerator? Does it go beyond that?
JA: It can be that, but we may also tune [the frequency and bandwidth of] the FPGA fabric architecture, or the implementation itself, to be better aligned to a particular application or needs. We use a variety of different techniques.
IC: That's through profiling customer workflows? You get together with customers to understand what they're doing, and what they're trying to solve?
JA: Exactly! We spend a lot of time with our customers making sure we understand their needs, not just for the next 12 months, but for the next 3+ years. We then map those customer needs, or application needs, back to the particular FPGA architectures [that they are interested in].
  IC: You mentioned earlier about client computing - you're very much in the sense of promoting FPGAs to help with AI accelerated camera analysis, people's webcams on devices, that sort of thing. Where exactly are we expecting to see Lattice in client computing in that regard?
JA: Client computing has been a growth area for us over the last few years - our client computing falls within our computing and communications segment, and that segment has been growing really well. It grew double digits last year, and it grew another 15% year over year in the most recent quarter so. Client computing has been a big contributor to that. There were a couple of new significant customer platforms that began ramping into production last year, and then are ramping into full production this year. And then we're engaged with a number of OEMs, and new client computing platforms.
When we say client computing, we're talking about basically PCs and tablets, those types of devices. But some of the interesting applications that we're getting used in are things like artificial intelligence. For instance, let's say I'm looking at my laptop, I'm doing work, but I turn away and I look away - maybe I'm having a conversation with somebody for a few minutes and I'm not looking at the laptop. Our device will be analyzing the video signal, and it will detect that you're still in front of the laptop, but that you've looked away. It will detect that using AI algorithms, and then the laptop screen will dim to save the battery power. Then as soon as you look back, it'll bring the screen back up. That may seem like not a big deal, but when you start to add up the power savings, the screen on the laptop burns a tremendous amount of power. If you save all of that battery life over the course of a full day, you can save quite a bit, and drive quite a bit of battery efficiency.
The other thing that our devices or FPGAs can do is watch the video input, and let's say somebody comes up behind you and they are shoulder surfing by looking over your shoulder at what you're working on. It can detect that there is somebody else in the frame, and then put a little red dot on screen or whatever to notify you that somebody is behind you, watching what you're doing. There's a bunch of other examples as well, but we can do this because our devices are small and really power efficient - we can do this at incredibly low levels of power.
Then another example would be security, some of that same security that we talked about on server devices is also applicable to client devices. So that's another potential application - but you know, one of the things we really like about this market is that if you look at the server space, which we already talked about, we've done really well and really proliferated Lattice across the server space. But the great thing about the client computing market is it's 20 times larger in terms of unit size. There are 20 clients for every one server, and so to us that's just a huge TAM opportunity to bring Lattice devices into that market and enable all new sorts of functionality and capability for end users.
IC: So the demonstration about looking away and having people over your shoulder, there is one company who has demonstrated that today, and that would be Intel. Are you working with Intel on that? Can I make that connection?
JA: [laughs] Well, what I would say is that we would view Intel in the PC segment as a strategic partner. We would certainly work with them on enabling those types of experiences. What I will point out is that our devices can do that functionality at ridiculously low power, so we have a big power efficiency advantage, and on a laptop device as you know power efficiency is a premium. So our devices can do that at a level that I don't think anyone else in the industry can. We would view Intel as a potential platform partner there along with everybody else in the ecosystem.
IC: That's a very crafty way of saying no. I love it!
IC: It makes me question with that sort of topic whether you would actually be working with the platform developer, or perhaps that would be more sort of an OEM enablement strategy - maybe it's something that the OEM wants to do, on top of a platform provided by a higher level partner?
JA: We would work with both - we do two things. We'd work directly with the OEM that's building the platform - we'd certainly have engaged with them. But then we'd also be working with the ecosystem as well to make sure that our parts are interoperable and work with the rest of the ecosystem partners, so we'd been doing both in parallel.
  IC: One of the things with FPGAs - I get a lot of feedback for is that they're just hard to develop for. You need to know how to use them before you use them, which sounds like the wrong way to learn how to code! What exactly is Lattice doing to kind of ease that transition for people who may understand software, but are kind of new to the hardware?
JA: This is really one of our main mantras at Lattice. [We want] to make the use of our devices as easy as possible. So this is something we've driven a tremendous amount of improvement, just over the last few years, to make the devices very easy to use. This is not just for people that are familiar with FPGAs, but for developers that may have never used an FPGA in their entire career.
So one of the big things that we've been doing over the last two to three years is developing what we call ‘application specific software solution stacks’. So think about these as pre-built tools and libraries that a customer can take off the shelf and use that to abstract out the complexity of an FPGA. It allows the customer to use our devices at a level of abstraction that they're comfortable with.
This is something we've been investing a tremendous amount of effort into, and we built out a pretty significant portfolio of these applications solutions and they make it very easy for the customer to adopt our devices into their systems so they can get the innovation. They can get access to the innovation that we're driving and get that easily, but also get to market much more quickly. Also, even if a customer is familiar with FPGAs, it can help them switch from a competitor's FPGA to our FPGA, so it can ease that switching or transition.
We're building out a portfolio of these stacks, and we brought four of them to market to date. The first one that we developed was called SenseAI. And that's a software stack that's specifically for artificial intelligence, for doing inference processing especially in edge applications. Whether those are consumer applications or industrial applications, it really helps enable inference processing on our devices at the edge of the network. That was the first one.
The second one was around embedded vision processing, and enabling embedded vision processing on our devices. The third one and we kind of touched on this earlier was actually around security and platform hardware security, making it really easy to use our devices for doing hardware security. Then the fourth one, which we just launched in May, was around factory automation. This is making it easy to design Lattice devices for doing all sorts of industrial automation tasks, as well as robotics.
So each one of these are, like I said, a pre-built solution that the customer can take and use as is, orif they want to customize it, they can do that. But it has really lowered the barrier, or reduced the effort necessary, to design devices into systems. We're going to continue to build out, we've got additional software stacks on the roadmap, and we'll continue to build out a wider portfolio here.
IC: To explain it my way, that would be like having precompiled libraries that manage the FPGA, and all you do is you call the library and the functions they're in and it does it automatically?
JA: That would be a good analogy!
  IC: So we spoke about the communications and compute segment earlier - Lattice's biggest market now is communications and compute, and it's not often we get a chance to direct users to think about what telecommunication companies (telcos) need out of their silicon. What makes Lattice FPGAs the right fit for telcos, and how are they using them?
JA: It's not just Lattice FPGAs, but the communications industry has a long history of using FPGAs in all sorts of applications. It’s not just wireless applications, which you're asking about, but wireline as well. You will find FPGAs used in all sorts of different places in communications.
In wireless applications, like the new 5G infrastructure that's being built out, you find Lattice devices in the control plane. If you look at a base station, which is basically processing at the bottom of the tower, and then the antenna at the top of the tower, you find Lattice devices in the baseband unit at the bottom of the tower, but also in the radio heads that are at the top of the tower, and the towers which are transmitting the signals. What we're doing there is controlling the management of the system, the power management, and then some security functionality moving forward as well.
A lot of times the reason is that in communications, especially wireless infrastructure, that FPGAs get used as we kind of think of 5G simplistically as one monolithic standard worldwide. That's not the case - there are umbrellas of standards that exist, and each region has different frequencies, different frequency bands, different local customizations, and then also the 5G or any wireless standard is evolving over time as well. A wireless infrastructure OEM may start to design a system before the 5G standard is fully completed, so they build FPGAs in because they need the ability to customize for, let's say, different geographies. They can reprogram the FPGA to adapt the system for different geographies with different unique requirements, rather than building a dedicated hardware system for each geography. Or if the standard evolves over time, there are new capabilities that they have to integrate into the system. They can reprogram the FPGA to adapt and include that new functionality in the system.
So it's a combination of the flexibility, as well as the adaptability, and some future proofing. That's why you see FPGAs get used. The 5G infrastructure has been a great growth area for us - we were really early in the 5G build out worldwide. You know, if you try to get a 5G signal, a true 5G signal, you know that there's a lot of build out that needs to happen, especially in North America and Europe. We're still early in that, and it is a great growth area for Lattice.
IC: You mentioned the control plane in 5G, and there's also the data plane - the telcos use FPGAs initially in the data plane to do all the data compute, and then replace it with their own ASIC over time. In the control plane, FPGAs tend not to be replaced - that kind of sustains your growth in that market? Is that fair to say?
JA: Yeah, that's exactly right. We're usually designed into the control plane. In the data plane, where the data is flowing through, that's where the primary data stream is flowing through the system. When a system is initially launched, the large FPGAs designed by our two traditional competitors may get used initially in those systems, and they may get replaced by ASICs because those very large FPGAs are extremely high power, and they're truly expensive too. So they may get replaced by ASICs.
Now our FPGAs, which are on the control plane, are smaller, power efficient, and generally don't get replaced by ASICs because, for all the reasons we talked about earlier, there's just not a big economic reason to change them, or from a technical standpoint, there's not a lot of power efficiency savings either.
  IC: With those large pieces of silicon from the main competitors, we see them be aggressive on packaging and using the latest process technology node. I assume these small iCE FPGAs aren't made on some 7 nm process are they? Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to see them, I think!
JA: [laughs] Well, I'm not sure the size would be that terribly different! A lot of times on a device like the iCE, the size of the silicon may be IO limited. The IO has both an analog and a digital component. The analog doesn't scale very well with technology, but the digital part does. So when you get to a certain size, being on the latest bleeding technology node actually isn't that big of a benefit, and in a lot of cases, a bigger technology node is perfectly fine. In some cases actually, it has some advantages. What we do with our devices is that we're always picking the technology node that's really optimized for the size of device that we're developing but also the customer needs that we're trying to get - and the time to market as well. For a lot of cases, it just doesn't make any sense for us to be on the bleeding edge of the technology.
 
Jim with a Threadripper
IC: I'd be remiss if I didn't get a chance to ask you about your time at AMD. I remember you and me talking over dinner in Maranello about the vision of the company at the time. You had the upper hand because you knew what was coming down the pipe! But are there any fond memories, or any special moments?
JA: It's been three years now, the memory starts to get fuzzy!
IC: But now you're not under NDA!
JA: That's true, actually! [laughs] First of all, when I think back about my time at AMD, my really fond memories are about the people. I keep in contact with a lot of people that I worked with at AMD who I consider really good friends. It was just a great group of people - you know, innovative, creative. AMD was always a really scrappy team. I loved that about AMD, and the people that are really determined. So that's always a fond memory.
If I had to think about what events or what things that AMD did that I have great memories about, launching the first Ryzen chips was absolutely a great highlight at the time that I was at AMD. It was the client business unit that launched the first Zen based devices, and of course, you were there for that launch! We launched it first into desktop, followed by mobile later. The amount of work that the team put into that, how hard we worked, and then the excitement and anticipation of just being able to finally bring Ryzen to market was really exciting.
Then the event that you mentioned at the very beginning, which was kind of the last event that I was at AMD, which was the Threadripper 2 launch. I loved that just because, I kind of always had a special place in my heart for Threadripper, because on that product line we just would sort of throw out the rulebook and just do whatever we can. Whatever the most extreme thing we could do, we would do on Threadripper, and I always have fun with that product line.
But yeah, it was a great time. The last three years at Lattice look fantastic; it feels like we've made a lot of progress over the last three years. We’ve rebuilt a product portfolio. But when I look forward, I'm much more excited about where we're headed over the next 3 to 5+ years. I think the next few years are much more exciting for the company than even the past three years have been. So I’m really excited about where we're headed.
IC: Do you have any project inside Lattice that is also sort of throws the rulebook out?
JA: Well, it's possible! It's possible. Stay tuned. 
    Many thanks to Jim Anderson and his team for their time.
Also thanks to Gavin Bonshor for transcription.

Looking forward to the new midrange silicon (Avant, iirc?). We're using both ECP5's and iCE parts today and have been very happy with Lattice's hardware. I just hope Avant has faster serdes - even something comparable to the 12.5 gbit lanes in the higher-end Kintex products would really expand what we can do with Lattice parts. (An RF guy I know insists regularly that what Lattice *really* needs is 18x25 DSP blocks, but I care less about that.)

Also, wasn't expecting to see Lattice on Anandtech today. That's one of the things that makes me like this site so much. :)

These dicksu... errm ""marketing"" articles should really be marked as an adverts.

Why haven't you asked any real questions ?
Like:
- They have ""presented"" quite a few series ( Certus/Certus Pro etc) _quite_ a while ago, but no chips are to be seen anywhere. Has he the one that came from AMD to teach Lattice the art of paper launches ?
- self-reprogrammability and reconfigurability are important ""skills"" of modern FPGAs, especially the ones that target IoT etc. When is Lattice to show us some of that ?
- so far they have acquired many separate tools, basically one for each family line. Many of them have to be licenced to cover interesting members and none work really well. Whe are we to see tool unification ?
- PCIe is becoming central piece of many everyday designs. And yet they require quite costly licence, ( which is time limited to boot).
- MIcrochip is stepping into FPGAs in serious way. I assume they will do something about the FPGAs/SoCs and tools unification. And probably merge new models with their microcontroller portfolio. What does Lattice intend to do to respond ?
-Microchip has introduced their first SoC with RISC-V. So far, these are big models with capable 64-bit cores, but we are certainly going to see small, low-cost models. Only thing the Lattice has are their soft-cores. So, is there something new to be seen ?
-Microchip is preparing new models with variable speed SERDES for new cheap mmbers that will allow cheap FPGA to be used with say PCIe v4x1. Only thing Lattice has to show is couple of ""paper"" models that can do PCIe3. None of them is really accessible, much less cheap.

Been watching Lattice for a long time. Glad to see them getting their act together. They seem to be on the right path.

Yeah, it’s been a few years but they always seemed to be last choice. It was Xilinx and Altera if you needed serious FPGA resources and good tools. Actel always had their niche (instant on, low power, NSEU mitigation) that you were willing to put up with their inferior tools. Lattice burned more than a few engineers and I can only think of some CPLD’s we used them for. But now I’m cheering for Actel (Microsemi) and lattice now that Altera and Xilinx are bought up. I don’t think these mega-corporations are good for America or technology in general. We need some scrappy underdogs to step up.

The goal of interviews like this is 99% introducing the readership to something they might not have thought about or know much about. These are very much REAL questions that a lot of people who haven't looked into Lattice before might be interested in. Think late-night talk show host stuff.

If I'm going to do a technical interview, it's going to be with a company the audience knows. Otherwise they won't care who it's about if they don't understand what the company is about, who the people are, and how they think.

If you think this is marketing then I can tell you don't work in marketing or the press. But for as much as I appreciate the input, if you didn't like it, then there is other stuff for you to read.

Also, his comments on Lattice development being ""fantastic"" are a bit lame.
When they need them to claim so themselves, you can tell that it hasn't been all that fantastic.
Here is something from their truly fun and fantastic times:

It's a shame there wasn't a question on his views on the role open source toolchain efforts have had on the popularity of some of lattice's products.

Icestorm and now the whole ecosystem of tooling around it are some of the main reason the ice40s are popular around the circles I'm in.

It seems right now Lattice tolerate the projects, would be good to know if the people at the top understood their importance - especially with all the talk of making it easier for developers.

Looks like an interesting project and props to the people who made it, but this looks like a solution looking for a problem. I don’t see why any commercial company that would buy a significant number of parts would use it. Tools matter a lot in this domain and the expectation is Lattice brings high quality first party tools and IP to the table. I wouldn’t want to bet my engineering career on kludgy, reverse engineered knockoffs.

  Governor Whitmer announces new semiconductor wafer manufacturing and R&D facility bringing 150 jobs near Bay City, and placemaking projects in Detroit 
  Semiconductor wafer manufacturer SK Siltron establishing new facility in Monitor Township to support electric vehicle growth, creating up to 150 jobs, investing $302 million 
Project builds on Michigan's leadership position in semiconductor supply chain, electric vehicle development by producing more of the chips the auto industry needs in-state  
Two community revitalization projects will generate total capital investment of $226 million, bring needed housing, new vibrancy to Detroit neighborhoods 
  LANSING, Mich. - Governor Gretchen Whitmer joined the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) to announce economic assistance for projects approved by the Michigan Strategic Fund Board today that will create 150 new jobs and generate more than $500 million in investment in Michigan. The projects include efforts to bring new semiconductor wafer manufacturing and R&D operations to the state which will help the auto industry by producing more of the chips they need right here in Michigan, as well as support for additional workforce housing projects in Detroit neighborhoods.  
  Together, these projects also build on the Governor's announcements this week to invest $2.1 billion to strengthen the state's middle class, support Michigan businesses and increase affordable housing in communities to usher in a new era of economic prosperity for Michigan. 
  ""Today's actions show our continued focus on jumpstarting Michigan's economy by creating good-paying jobs, building on our state's advanced manufacturing and tech sectors, and supporting transformational placemaking efforts in communities,"" said Governor Whitmer. ""These projects are further proof that Michigan is a place where technology, research and innovation are paired with a fierce work ethic that creates economic opportunities for businesses of all sizes."" 
  New semiconductor wafer manufacturing/R&D facility in Monitor Township to create 150 jobs, underscore Michigan's leadership role in semiconductor supply chain 
  SK Siltron CSS, headquartered in Auburn, Michigan, is a manufacturer of semiconductor wafers used in power system components. The company is a subsidiary of SK Siltron, an operating company of South Korea's SK Group. 
  The demand for power semiconductors is rapidly increasing as automakers enter the electric vehicle market and telecommunication companies expand 5G capabilities. SK Siltron CSS plans to expand production of much-needed silicon carbide wafers, considered the future of the industry because of their ability to efficiently transfer energy. The company is acquiring and rehabilitating a facility in Monitor Township (near Bay City) to support its growth. The project is expected to generate a total capital investment of $302 million and create up to 150 jobs, supported by a $1.5 million Michigan Business Development Program performance-based grant. Michigan was chosen for the project over sites in Georgia, North and South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas for its talent and proximity to automakers.  
  ""SK Siltron's high-profile commitment proves further evidence that Michigan remains a place where high-tech talent needs can be met and tech companies can grow, and we thank the company for its vote of confidence in our state and our workforce,"" said Quentin Messer, Jr., CEO of the MEDC and President and Chair of the Michigan Strategic Fund. ""The company's investment in Michigan is a clear example of how top attraction projects are finding opportunities to grow in the state underscoring Michigan's leadership position in electric vehicle R&D and manufacturing."" 
  The project will attract high-wage jobs in high-tech manufacturing ranging from semi-skilled operators to engineers, and will continue to strengthen Michigan's automotive, mobility and advanced manufacturing industries. Adding the new jobs and the significant investment in Michigan solidifies the company's presence and potential future investment here. 
  ""The growth of electric vehicles is opening an exciting new chapter for the auto industry as it provides consumers with more environmentally friendly transportation options,"" said Jianwei Dong, chief executive officer for SK Siltron CSS. ""SK Siltron CSS is proud to partner with the State of Michigan to build the supply chain and create the skilled jobs required to support the next generation of EVs, ensuring Michigan remains the automotive center of the world."" 
  In July, the Michigan Strategic Fund announced support for Ford's new global battery center of excellence in Romulus, further evidence that Michigan continues to emerge as an electric vehicle R&D and manufacturing leader. 
  Michigan's automotive industry purchased nearly $35 million in products and services from semiconductor companies in Michigan in 2020, building on the state's leadership in semiconductor R&D and testing due in large part to the state's talent and processes supported by Hemlock Semiconductor, KLA in Ann Arbor and the University of Michigan, which is the top global institute for semiconductor training on today's issues to help solve tomorrow's problems. As Michigan also continues leading the mobility industry in the development of electric and autonomous vehicles, demand for semiconductor manufacturers like SK Siltron is expected to skyrocket over the coming years. 
  The Michigan Strategic Fund also approved a 15-year State Essential Services Assessment exemption valued at $4.4 million. Monitor Township is considering a property tax abatement in support of the project, and MEDC approved a State Education Tax abatement to be used in conjunction with the local abatement. Bay Future, Inc. has worked with the company and the MEDC throughout the process offering staff time and resources in coordinating site selection activities, identifying and bringing local resources and resource partners to the table, and more.     
  ""SK Siltron CSS is a world class, high tech, company that could have chosen to invest anywhere in the world.  We are appreciative that they decided to chose to invest here in Bay County. Our community, region, and state have a storied history of manufacturing, specifically in the automotive industry,"" said Bay Future, Inc. President and CEO Trevor Keyes. ""This investment represents the future of that foundation where ingenuity and know-how will drive an engine of innovation and technology.  We are pleased and thankful for having had the opportunity to work closely with the MSF, the MEDC, and SK Siltron CSS to secure this significant capital investment and new job creating project.""  
  Individuals interested in careers with SK Siltron CSS should visit https://sksiltroncss.com/.   
  Community revitalization projects will bring total of $226.1 million in investment, new workforce housing to Detroit, underscores Michigan as a leading hub for mobility and electrification 
      The Corktown Mixed-Use Project will construct three mixed-use buildings on Michigan Avenue in the Corktown neighborhood of Detroit. When completed, the project will include 188 apartments, seven townhomes, parking, and retail space. At least 10 percent of the apartments will have rents targeting those residents at 60 percent of average median income. In addition, public infrastructure improvements will be made to the site, including sidewalks, brick pavers, curbs, and gutters, paving and landscaping in the public space. 
  The project is expected to generate a total capital investment of $93 million and result in the creation of 62 jobs, and will transform an underutilized site into a vibrant mixed-use development that will bring much-needed workforce housing and add density to the historic neighborhood. Corktown is rapidly becoming a major employment center, as Ford's new Corktown campus houses many new electric and autonomous vehicle operations and is attracting additional vendors and suppliers to the area. The recently-announced Detroit Smart Parking Lab, also located in Corktown, opens in September and will allow mobility and smart infrastructure pioneers and real-estate innovators and startups to test parking-related mobility, logistics and electric vehicle charging technologies. The Detroit Smart Parking Lab will also expand parking scenarios beyond parking structures.  
  The City of Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority received Michigan Strategic Fund approval of a brownfield work plan and $5.8 million in state tax capture that will be used to alleviate brownfield conditions at the site. The city of Detroit is supporting the project with $10.1 million in local brownfield reimbursement and has approved a Commercial Rehabilitation Act tax abatement valued at $10.6 million. The city of Detroit is engaged with MEDC's Redevelopment Ready Communities program. 
      Lafayette Acquisition Partners, LLC plans to construct six new five-story buildings on a vacant, underutilized lot in the Lafayette Park Neighborhood of Detroit. When completed, the Lafayette West Project will include rental apartments and for-sale condominiums as well as commercial space, along with amenities such as a pool, clubhouse, and greenspace. Approximately 20 percent of the rental units will be held at rents considered affordable for renters making 80 percent of the Area Mean Income. The commercial spaces will target local, place-based businesses and address underserved markets. The project will also include public improvements including landscaping, public lighting, sidewalks and more. 
  The project is expected to generate a total capital investment of $133.1 million, and will bring workforce housing, an improved sense of place, and increased density and walkability to the Lafayette Park Neighborhood.   
  The City of Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority today received MSF approval of state capture valued at $5 million for the alleviation of brownfield conditions at the site. The city of Detroit is supporting the project through the local portion of the brownfield work plan valued at $12.7 million and an anticipated 15-year Neighborhood Enterprise Zone certification valued at $9.4 million.  
  ""The MSF's actions demonstrate that our efforts to lead an equitable and resilient economic recovery are working,"" Messer said. ""The projects approved today reflect our people-centric approach to economic development and our focus on building a championship economy here in Michigan."" 
  ""Some 513 new housing units and 16,000 sq.-ft. of retail are being created in the City of Detroit with the help of Tax Increment Financing, thanks to the approval of the MSF and local community support,"" said Detroit Economic Growth Corporation President and CEO Kevin Johnson. ""This tool continues to be essential in catalyzing development in the face of construction costs and pandemic related headwinds - all without impacting the City's current tax revenue. The DEGC is pleased to collaborate with the City and State to create new developments that serve our residents with affordable housing and more small business offerings."" 
  The Michigan Strategic Fund also approved a bond authorizing resolution for private activity bond financing of up to $125 million for the Graphic Packaging International, LLC Solid Waste Disposal Facility project in Kalamazoo. The company will use the proceeds of the bonds to finance the construction, improvement and installation of certain solid waste disposal facilities relating to a new coated recycled board machine to be installed at the Kalamazoo Mill. This financing is part of an estimated $615 million capital investment at the mill. The company has already hired 70 new employees since these investments began, with 55 of those individuals being residents of Kalamazoo County. The city of Kalamazoo and Southwest Michigan First are also supportive of the project.

The global semiconductor intellectual property (IP) market is expected to grow from $4.60 billion in 2020 to $5.06 billion in 2021 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10%. The growth is mainly due to the companies resuming their operations and adapting to the new normal while recovering from the COVID-19 impact, which had earlier led to restrictive containment measures involving social distancing, remote working, and the closure of commercial activities that resulted in operational challenges. The market is expected to reach $7.02 billion in 2025 at a CAGR of 8.5%.

The semiconductor intellectual property (IP) market consists of sales of semiconductor intellectual property and related services by entities (organizations, sole traders, and partnerships) that provide integrated circuit layout design that is the intellectual property of its creator or party.Semiconductor IP is a piece of design that is a reusable unit of logic or functionality or a layout of a design that is developed with the idea of licensing it to many vendors for using it as a building block in different chip designs.

There is a license fee for its usage or royalty for every device made using that piece of IP.

The main types of design IP in semiconductor intellectual property (IP) are processor IP, interface IP, memory IP, and others.The processor IP offers an intellectual property right for the design of the processor.

Processors are typically produced in the form of soft IP and analog blocks.The different IP cores involve softcore, hardcore and include various revenue sources such as royalty, licensing.

It is implemented in several sectors such as consumer electronics, telecom, automotive, healthcare, and others.

Asia Pacific was the largest region in the semiconductor intellectual property (IP) market in 2020.North America was the second-largest market in the semiconductor intellectual property market.

Silicon in the Valley: Creating opportunities to benefit Arizonans
September 16, 2021
ASU is fueling a semiconductor revolution to improve U.S. advanced manufacturing capabilities, generate jobs and strengthen the economy
Editor's note: This story originally appeared in the fall 2021 issue of ASU Thrive magazine.
Silicon is an example of a semiconductor, materials that have the characteristics of both a conductor, such as copper, and an insulator, like glass, allowing engineers to precisely dial in exact electricity flow under specific conditions. This makes semiconductors well-suited for building the microscopic circuits at the heart of the computers in our devices.
Every year, more than a trillion semiconductors roll off assembly lines to meet an insatiable appetite for microelectronics that are faster, smarter, cheaper; demand is growing.
The U.S., birthplace of semiconductors, was once the global manufacturing leader. But over the past few decades, competition drove many manufacturers abroad. According to the Semiconductor Industry Association, today the U.S. manufactures about 12% of the world’s semiconductors.
Building up the semiconductor ecosystem in this state will bring industry and jobs. This is an economic
opportunity that improves our well-being.”
— Sally C. Morton, executive vice president, ASU Knowledge Enterprise
The coronavirus pandemic exposed the risks of relying on an international supply chain for a critical product. As the virus circled the globe, worldwide semiconductor manufacturing facilities — called fabs — came to a standstill. Suddenly, no one could get their hands on the chips that power the modern world. The shortage has held up production for cars, televisions, washing machines and even smart toasters.
Politicians in Washington, D.C., realized that semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. is a matter of national security. When President Joe Biden announced his administration’s $2 trillion infrastructure bill, he held a semiconductor chip aloft to underscore the industry’s prominent place in the bill.
“This is infrastructure,” Biden said. “We’ve been falling behind on research and development and manufacturing, and, to put it bluntly, we have to step up our game.”
Sally C. Morton, executive vice president of Arizona State University’s Knowledge Enterprise, agrees. She highlights the fundamental importance of semiconductor chips in our daily lives and in national security.
“Everyone is impacted by semiconductors, but we don’t always see all the ways that microchips support the lives we lead,” Morton says. “We need to have autonomy in this space for both production and distribution.”
Arizona’s chip investment
Because of strong historical roots and rapid expansion, Arizona is poised to be at the epicenter of the American semiconductor revolution, with ASU playing a starring role. Last spring, two of the world’s largest chipmakers, Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, announced plans to spend a combined $32 billion building three semiconductor fabs in the Phoenix region, with TSMC purchasing enough land to possibly build five more fabs, which would invest billions of dollars more. Around the same time, Samsung shortlisted Phoenix as a possible factory site.
The interest in Phoenix makes sense. For decades, city officials, business leaders and ASU cultivated the infrastructure, regulatory environment and human talent the industry needs. And their timing couldn’t have been better. Worldwide semiconductor industry sales hit $439 billion in 2020, according to the SIA, with the industry projected to reach $803.15 billion by 2028.
“Building up the semiconductor ecosystem in this state will bring industry and jobs,” Morton says. “This is an economic opportunity that improves our well-being.”
Local partnerships, global impact
When Michael Kozicki, a professor of electrical engineering and director of the Center for Applied Nanoionics, first arrived at ASU in 1985, semiconductor manufacturing had already established a foothold in the area. Intel and Motorola anchored it, building a foundation that includes NXP, ON Semiconductor, Microchip Technology, Medtronic and others.
Kozicki’s ability to straddle the divide between industry and academia has proved invaluable for preparing generations of Sun Devils for careers at the world’s largest chipmakers. Today, he leads courses covering everything from working in the planet’s cleanest laboratories to designing next-gen chips, a heady mixture of practical and experimental knowledge that students need to drive nonstop innovation in microelectronic engineering.
“There are not many universities that do courses in semiconductor fabrication where you get a hands-on, industry-relevant education,” Kozicki says. “It’s all part of getting people ready to be productive professionals within the semiconductor industry. We’re a major supplier of talent.”
ASU’s emphasis on industry-relevant research has forged mutually beneficial partnerships with local semiconductor firms. In 2017, for example, the university partnered with ON Semiconductor, a Phoenix-based supplier to the global industry, to establish a $2 million, five-year award to support two ASU professors working on the leading engineering and supply chain issues faced by manufacturers.
One of the award recipients is Bertan Bakkaloglu, a professor of electrical engineering. His research focuses on analog circuit design. It’s foundational for the emerging Internet of Things, connecting machines to the web to monitor and control them remotely. To turn off lightbulbs while away, a conventional copper switch isn’t going to cut it.
Bakkaloglu says the ON Semiconductor professorship critically supports his students’ research efforts. Manufacturing small batches of experimental semiconductor chips can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Still, the process of taking a chip from concept to fabrication is a critical experience that prepares students for the industry’s challenges.
Through a partnership, Zachary Holman and his research group help semiconductor giant Applied Materials improve processes and materials.
“Our students gain experience in areas that almost every semiconductor company in town requires,” Bakkaloglu says. “My PhDs don’t go to the Bay Area or Texas. They stay in Arizona. So it’s a fundamental win-win because there’s a shortage of qualified semiconductor designers, and these companies get graduates who hit the ground running.”
Last year, the university struck an agreement with Applied Materials, a California-based company that builds the precision machinery used in most of the world’s chip fabs. As part of the partnership, Applied Materials funds at least five years of research with selected faculty members, including Kozicki, and their students, and leases lab space at ASU’s MacroTechnology Works in Tempe.
MTW, formerly a fabrication facility, came equipped with specialized infrastructure to handle semiconductor research. It already housed two semiconductor research powerhouses — ASU’s Flexible Electronics and Display Center and the Solar Power Laboratory.
“Faculty connecting with industry leaders not only speeds the process of translating university research discoveries and innovations to practice but can also provide a critical pathway for industry to de-risk some of their early ideas,” says Kyle Squires, dean of ASU’s Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering. “Promoting interactions with industry leaders matters. It helps our faculty sharpen their research ideas, substantially benefits our students, and leads to genuine impact. Unique infrastructure in locations such as MTW has given Arizona a competitive advantage.”
The Fulton Schools will further boost Phoenix’s reputation as semiconductor central with the recent launch of the School of Manufacturing Systems and Networks, which focuses on the research and education needed to drive the ideas critical to technology development for the Fourth Industrial Revolution. ASU’s newest engineering school will prepare students to meet the challenges of industry 4.0, with semiconductor-related engineering and research a core component.
“Without a doubt, the school will play a role in helping industry leaders think about what the fab facility of the future looks like,” Squires says. “How can you neglect that, given what’s happening in the Valley with semiconductor manufacturing?”
ASU science and engineering driving innovation
Advanced research and development is the name of the game in the semiconductor industry, and those who can’t innovate don’t last long. Throughout Kozicki’s time at ASU, he has seen the industry undergo massive changes. When he first started, “We thought we were cool for making chips on the micron-scale,” he says. These days, semiconductor companies manufacture chips hundreds of times smaller. The complex process involves stacking layers of silicon and other materials that are just a few atoms thick and etching microscopic circuit patterns into them by exposing them to chemicals and intense UV light. While these processes have enabled chips with circuits just a dozen atoms wide, manufacturers constantly look for ways to achieve more performance.
Cun-Zheng Ning is a professor of electrical engineering whose research shows just how far semiconductor fabrication techniques have come. Ning joined ASU in 2006 from NASA’s Center for Nanotechnology, and his work focuses on using semiconductors to create optical devices such as nanolasers. These tiny lasers are made by growing semiconductor wires only a few nanometers in diameter — thousands of times smaller than a human hair — but their exact mechanisms aren’t fully understood. The goal of Ning’s research group is to probe the limits of nanolaser size and performance. He hopes to lay the foundation for a “supercomputer on a chip” that would allow small electronic devices to crunch data at speeds that today would require a room-sized computer.
Historically, the primary driver of performance increases in semiconductor devices has been size. For decades, the industry has been locked in a race to make ever smaller circuits. But as semiconductor companies approach the physical limits of circuit miniaturization, to improve chips, they’re looking to advanced manufacturing processes that use tools such as 3D printing or artificial intelligence.
Bruno Azeredo, an assistant professor of manufacturing engineering, recently won a $500,000 award from the National Science Foundation to continue his work on Mac-Imprint, a new way of mass manufacturing 3D chips. Today, most chips are made by stacking films, but this creates performance issues. Building circuits in three dimensions can solve this problem and open new applications. But existing 3D nanoscale fabrication processes are ill-suited for mass manufacturing. Azeredo’s technique uses electrochemistry carving to make 3D structures in silicon at unfathomably small scales.
These days, he’s working with Honeywell to develop optical interconnects that allow data to flow from a chip into an optical fiber without losing information. The semiconductor lenses can focus the light pulses from the chip and cross the barrier into the optical fiber so it can be routed to another location.
“The companies that are coming here are doing more advanced work,” says Azeredo. “The semiconductor industry wants to have an edge, they want to know what’s coming next, and I can get the technology from readiness level 0 to readiness level 1.”
These represent some of ASU’s many faculty members engaging in semiconductor research. A few others include additional Applied Materials funding awardees Sefaattin Tongay, associate professor of materials science, for new semiconductor base material for advanced transistors; Heather Emady, assistant professor of chemical engineering, for material flow and heat transfer in semiconductor materials and processes; and Zachary Holman, associate professor of electrical engineering, for new materials and device designs for high-efficiency silicon.
Benefiting Arizonans
Dennis Hoffman, a professor of economics and director of the L. William Seidman Research Institute at the W. P. Carey School of Business, says semiconductor manufacturers making a home in the Grand Canyon State support Arizonans.

“Every electronics manufacturing job accounts for another five or so jobs in vendors and suppliers,” Hoffman says. “It’s a valuable asset for the state’s economy.”
Earlier this year, the Senate passed the United States Innovation and Competition Act, which includes $52 billion to boost semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. Hoffman sees this, and other national and state funding, as prudent investments that will deliver benefits to Arizonans.

For Morton, the growth of the semiconductor industry in Phoenix underscores the importance of collaboration between the university and industry driven by organizations such as ASU’s Knowledge Enterprise. It’s critical that the R&D Sun Devils do in the lab makes its way into the real world so that new technologies don’t get trapped in the so-called “valley of death,” the gap between academic innovation and commercial application.
“We don’t want to just do research, we want to disseminate research and implement it to have an impact on the world,” Morton says. “This is at the heart of the mission of ASU: research of public value and service to our communities. This is what we do. This is primary.”

General Motors reported a sharp drop in third-quarter U.S. sales on Friday as the global semiconductor crunch depletes dealerships of auto supply amid still-strong consumer demand.
The U.S. automaker giant described auto inventories as ""historically low"" after months of limited semiconductor supply, which has led to manufacturing outages and cuts throughout its plant network.
GM reported third-quarter sales of 446,997 in the United States, down almost a third from the year-ago period.
In the most recent quarter, the chip shortage was exacerbated by a surge in COVID-19 cases in Malaysia, which is home to key semiconductor capacity.
But Steve Carlisle, executive vice president of GM North America, said the issues with chips ""are improving"" and that it looks forward to a ""more stable operating environment through the fall.""
One upside of the supply crunch for automakers has been rising vehicle prices, which can help offset some of the pain from lower sales.
In the third quarter, GM's average vehicle price was $47,467, up almost 32 percent from the equivalent period in 2018.
""While supply has been constraining sales in recent months, underlying demand conditions remain strong, thanks to ample job openings, growing pent-up vehicle demand and excess savings accumulated by many households during the pandemic,"" said GM Chief Economist Elaine Buckberg.
""We expect to continue selling every vehicle we can produce with rapid turnover.""

Germany to invest billions to bring semiconductor production back to Europe

As part of a major European project, Germany wants to invest several billion euros into bringing semiconductor production back to Europe, with the aim of strengthening German and European technological sovereignty. EURACTIV Germany reports.
To promote the expansion of microelectronics in Germany, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier held talks with 50 representatives of the European and international semiconductor industry on Wednesday (1 September) to encourage them to invest in Germany by presenting them with a support package.
“Access to sufficient microchips will become a competitive element for any successful global economy in the coming years,” Altmaier stressed at a press conference on Wednesday.
“This means we must act if we want to preserve our technological sovereignty,” Altmaier added.
Within the framework of the European Initiative ‘Important Projects of Common European Interest’ (IPCEI) – one of the EU’s key subsidy tools to stimulate investment and reduce dependence on imports – the German government intends to invest around €3 billion to reclaim production sites along the entire value chain of semiconductor production.
This initiative is primarily motivated by the worldwide semiconductor supply shortage resulting in production losses across the industry. The demand for semiconductors has grown exponentially in recent years, which is partly due to the increased demand caused by Industry 4.0 and the Internet of Things.
According to Altmaier, Germany wants to prepare itself in particular for the digital and environmental challenges of the future. Both e-mobility and Industry 4.0 require much more powerful semiconductors than are currently produced in Germany and Europe.
German carmakers partially shut down amid semiconductor shortage
The German automotive industry is continuing to struggle with a severe supply shortage in semiconductors, while national and European authorities are trying to boost local production capacities.
Europe lagging behind
For years, the manufacturing of semiconductors in Europe has been on the decline compared to production in the rest of the world. Europe’s share dropped from 35% in 1990 to a current meagre 9%.
The European Commission now wants to reverse this trend. According to its Digital Compass, the aim is to have the EU cover 20% of international production by 2030. But with the market growing at an exponential pace, production capacities would have to be tripled or even quadrupled to reach the 2030 target set by the Commission.
Europe is not just trailing behind in terms of numbers, but also with respect to quality. Most advanced microchips, which are used in smartphones, computers and other high-tech devices, are currently produced almost exclusively in Asia.
European producers, like NXP or Infineon, focus mainly on producing semiconductors for the industry, which are technologically less refined than the semiconductors developed by their Asian competitors.
Asian companies like TSMC or Samsung are already specialising in the production of 3-nanometre process of semiconductor production – a new, improved generation of silicon semiconductor chips in terms of increased transistor density, increased speed and reduced power consumption.
Europe is lagging behind as most of its production facilities – except for the Intel factory in Ireland – focus on 20-nanometre production.
But the EU is eager to address this gap.
In December last year, Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton said the bloc wants to focus on the high-tech sector in semiconductor production and has set its sights on developing 2-nanometre production on European soil.
Europe's first digitalised chip plant opens in Dresden
German engineering and technology company Bosch opened a new semiconductor factory, fully networked with 5G mobile technology, in Dresden on Monday (7 June). The production facility was funded with €140 million as part of a joint European project.
The right path to digital sovereignty?
Altmaier is confident the 20% target can be reached by 2030 and the technological backlog in production can be reduced through IPCEI funding, which in turn should encourage more semiconductor manufacturers to invest in Germany and Europe.
The minister referred to a success story from 2018, when a €1 billion in public funding through an IPCEI had triggered three times the amount of private investment, noting that the instrument is thus “the right instrument to preserve Europe’s sovereignty,” the minister continued.
The German and European ambitions were also welcomed by the industry.
“The announcements at the European level and by the German government are right and important for our industry,” Frank Bösenberg, head of the office of Silicon Saxony, one of Germany’s leading microelectronics industry associations, told EURACTIV.
The “world is not waiting for Europe,” he added.
But others have doubts about the viability and feasibility of the investment offensive.
Reaching the 20% target is “completely unrealistic”, said Niclas Poitiers of the think-tank Bruegel. Europe is still lagging behind other countries like the US or Japan, particularly in terms of the size of investments.
Increasing the number of production sites alone does not automatically lead to less dependency and greater digital sovereignty, “because in the global world economy, supply chains are so tightly interlinked across so many borders that dependencies remain even if sub-sectors of the semiconductor industry are massively expanded locally,” Poitiers explained.
The EU would therefore be better advised to invest in existing strengths instead of fighting an uphill battle, he added.

The ‘pearls’ and shiney suits brigade in the EU need to understand how Tesla came to dominate the NASDAQ. Elon’s success was bankrolled by dark money channelled by the US Government. How else would markets have made the absurd bets that have driven the price earnings ratio to 382 as I type. This is a company that sells 8 billion USD worth of crap cars (harsh? check the metrology next time you see one in a carpark)

Despite rapid development of electric vehicles (EVs), the safety of the lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries remains a concern as they are as a fire and explosion risk. Among the various approaches to tackle this issue, Korean researchers have used semiconductor technology to improve the safety of Li-ion batteries. A research team from the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) led by Dr. Joong Kee Lee of the Center for Energy Storage Research has succeeded in inhibiting the growth of dendrites, crystals with multiple branches that cause EV battery fires by forming protective semiconducting passivation layers on the surface of Li electrodes.
When Li-ion batteries are charged, Li ions are transported to the anode (the negative electrode) and are deposited on the surface as Li metal; at this point, tree-like dendrites are formed. These Li dendrites are responsible for the uncontrollable volumetric fluctuations and leads to reactions between the solid electrode and the liquid electrolyte, which causes a fire. Unsurprisingly, this severely degrades battery performance.
To prevent dendrite formation, the research team exposed fullerene (C60), a highly electronic conductive semiconductor material, to plasma, resulting in the formation of semiconducting passivation carbonaceous layers between the Li electrode and the electrolyte. The semiconducting passivation carbonaceous layers allow Li-ions to pass through while blocking electrons due to generation of Schottky barrier, and by preventing electrons and ions from interacting on the electrode surface and inside, they stops the formation of Li crystals and the consequent growth of dendrites.
*fullerene : a particular physical form of carbon in which 60 carbon atoms are connected by single and double bonds in a pentagonal shape to form a soccer ball-like shape
The stability of the electrodes with the semiconducting passivation carbonaceous layers was tested using Li/Li symmetric cells in extreme electrochemical environments where typical Li electrodes remain stable for up to 20 charge/discharge cycles. The newly developed electrodes showed significantly enhanced stability, with Li dendrite growth suppressed for up to 1,200 cycles. Moreover, using a lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) cathode in addition to the developed electrode, approximately 81% of the initial battery capacity was maintained after 500 cycles, representing an improvement of approximately 60% over conventional Li electrodes.
Lead researcher Dr. Joong Kee Lee said, ""The effective suppression of dendrite growth on Li electrodes is instrumental for improving battery safety. The technology for developing highly safe Li-metal electrodes proposed in this study provides a blueprint for the development of next-generation batteries that do not pose a fire risk."" As Dr. Lee explains, his team's next goal is improving the commercial viability of this technology, ""We aim to make the fabrication of the semiconducting passivation carbonaceous layers more cost-effective by substituting fullerene with less expensive materials.""

This research was carried out as part of a KIST's institutional R&D project and a mid-career researcher project. It also received funding as an outstanding new overseas research project from the National Research Foundation of Korea with the support of the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT). The results of this study are published in the latest issue of 'ACS Energy Letters' (IF: 19.003, Top 1.852% in JCR), a highly respected international journal in the field of materials science.

Global semiconductor chip shortage likely to get worse, further pushing prices higher
ANALYST REPORTS
Monday, 20 Sep 2021
11:51 AM MYT
KUALA LUMPUR: Prices for semiconductor chips are expected to rise across the spectrum given that the global chip shortage is likely to last until sometime late next year.

Moody's Analytics said the trend towards remote work that accelerated due to COVID-19 movement restrictions has given rise to heightened demand for semiconductor chips.

""Given the capital-intensive nature of their production process, supply has not been able to keep pace with the increase in demand,"" it said in a note today.

It noted that the world’s largest chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, has been raising prices across the spectrum, some by as much as 20 per cent, while three Chinese chipmakers have been fined by the Chinese government for abnormally high price increases.

""Chip prices have already risen, and they are likely to rise even further.

""What are some downstream effects from these price and quantity dynamics? Car prices have risen significantly, with average unit sales US$8,200 higher than two years ago, and we can expect more of the same,"" it added.

Moody's Analytics noted that the Chinese manufacturing producer price index (PPI) is soaring, and similar pass-through effects can be seen in other manufacturing PPIs worldwide.

""With the Purchasing Managers' Index for most of the countries that have significant chip production capability falling over time, we can expect the shortage to linger for a while and should be prepared for a bumpy ride ahead,"" it said. - Bernama

Semiconductor stocks, such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ: AMD) and NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ: NXPI) took a hit on Tuesday, with supply chain fears moving the industry lower. 
Why Is It Moving? 
Shares of NXP Semiconductors traded lower again on Wednesday after Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon downgraded the stock from Outperform to Market Perform and lowered the price target from $245 to $230.
Rasgon noted the firm is ""growing somewhat uncomfortable"" with the stock's valuation and automotive end market. It is a ""clear certainty that auto semis are 'over shipping auto production.'"" 
Price Action: 
Shares of NXP Semiconductors were trading lower by nearly 3% on Wednesday. This brings the stock down more than 7% from its close of $216.69 on Monday. NXP Semiconductors lagged behind its competitors on Wednesday, with NVIDIA and AMD relatively flat.

Insider Buying Could Indicate a Bottom in These 2 Stocks
Buying low and selling high may sound too basic to support a stock portfolio, but it has been and always will be a sure way to build profits. The only real trick to it – and it’s admittedly a tough trick to learn – is finding when a stock is at or near the bottom, to buy in. Plenty of stocks fall in price, that’s nothing new in the market. But most times, there’s a good reason, and it’s usually based in fundamental unsoundness. Successful investors will learn some way to sort this chaff from the

Shares of electric vehicle maker Nio (NYSE: NIO) rose 3% Friday morning before losing ground as the day progressed, trading down just about 0.5% as of 1:40 p.m. today. The weakness in the EV stock's price is surprising given that Nio reached a milestone and reported solid delivery numbers for September today, even topping its own projections. Nio delivered a record number of 10,628 vehicles in total in September, up 125.7% year over year.

Tesla has weathered the chip crisis better than rivals, with its overall deliveries surging 20% in the July to September period from its previous record in the second quarter, marking the sixth consecutive quarter-on-quarter gains. In China, rising exports to Europe and the introduction of a cheaper Model Y helped boost Tesla's production, analysts said. Musk said Tesla suffered an extremely severe parts shortage earlier in the third quarter and had urged employees to make quarter-end delivery push, Reuters reported last month, citing an internal company email.

(Adds details, context)
TURIN, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk said on Friday that thanks to new semiconductor plants that are planned or under construction, the global chip shortage that has pummelled the car industry this year should be short term in nature.
Asked how long he thought the global chip shortage would affect vehicle production, Musk said: ""short term I think"".
""There's a lot of chip fabrication plants that are being built,"" Musk said during a joint session with Stellantis and Ferrari Chairman John Elkann, at Italian Tech Week.
""I think we will have good capacity for providing chips by next year,"" he added.
The two automotive industry leaders agreed on potential support coming from nuclear power to cover for increasing global energy needs.
""I am surprised by a recent move away of some countries form nuclear energy, which is safe,"" Musk said.
But in their dialogue they avoided referring to competition issues between top electric mobility leaders such as Tesla and legacy automakers now investing heavily to expand their offer of electrified vehicles.
Musk however thanked Elkann for a support Tesla received between 2017 and 2019 from Comau, the robot unit of Fiat Chrysler, now part of Stellantis, during what he called ""one of the most painful periods"" for his company, linked to the launch of production on Model 3.
""John helped me a lot in that period,"" Musk said, adding Tesla had come close to bankruptcy ""half a dozen times"".
Stellantis Chief Executive Carlos Tavares has said the group, formed through the merger between Fiat Chrysler and France's PSA, expected to achieve its European carbon dioxide emission targets this year without credits bought from Tesla.

Citing U.S. Energy Information Administration data, the investment manager said global oil demand peaked at 101 million barrels per day (mbd) in 2019, dropped to 92 mbd during the coronavirus in 2020, and has since rebounded to 97 mbd in 2021. “Based on our forecast for EV sales, @ARKInvest believes that oil demand has peaked,” Wood said.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

COVID-fuelled semiconductor crunch chips away at carmakers
By Nick Carey
3 minute read

LONDON, Aug 19 (Reuters) - In grim warnings this week, major carmakers including Toyota (7203.T) and Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) offered fresh evidence that the auto industry remains firmly in the grip of an ongoing semiconductor chip shortage that shows no sign of abating.
After being forced to close plants last year as the pandemic took hold, carmakers are now facing stiff competition from the sprawling consumer electronics industry for chip deliveries amid global supply chain disruption.
The latest snarl up comes as COVID-19 cases surge in Asian countries home to auto factories and chip plants such as Japan, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia, leading to stricter curbs to prevent the spread of the virus.
Japan's Toyota, thanks to a policy of stockpiling chips that dates back a decade to the 2011 earthquake and Fukushima nuclear disaster, had largely managed to avoid production cuts. read more
But the world's largest automaker by sales volumes said on Thursday it will slash global production for September by 40% from its previous plan, affecting 14 plants in Japan and elsewhere, including most of its North American factories. read more
Automobiles have become increasingly dependent on chips for everything from computer management of engines for better fuel economy to driver-assistance features such as emergency braking.
Germany's Volkswagen also said on Thursday that it couldn't rule out further changes to production. read more
""We currently expect supply of chips in the third quarter to be very volatile and tight,"" the No.2 volume carmaker behind Toyota told Reuters.
World No. 4 Stellantis (STLA.MI) joined the chorus, saying it would halt production at a plant in western France next week and cut output at another factory in the eastern part of the country.
Ford Motor Co (F.N) had already said earlier this week that it will temporarily halt building its best-selling, profit-driving F-150 pickup truck at its Kansas City assembly plant, while China's Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd (0175.HK) warned the recent worsening of the chip shortage and resurgence of COVID-19 cases could pose a ""significant threat"" to its sales performance over the next few months. read more
Although Volkswagen said it expected the situation to improve by the end of the year, some carmakers have warned the chip crisis will drag on into 2022 with earlier industry hopes of a quick resolution long since dashed. read more
As numerous American auto production lines stand idle, at least part of the time, a trio of Democratic senators asked the Taiwanese government for more help to address the chip shortage, according to a letter reviewed by Reuters. read more
But even when one kink in the supply chain gets straightened out, others appear, making it difficult to ensure a consistent flow of chips and leaving damage-limitation focused automakers pushing available components to their more profitable models.
""The situation does remain fluid,"" General Motors Co (GM.N) Chief Executive Mary Barra said on a conference call on August 4, noting the impact of events such as the current COVID-19 spike in Malaysia.

Boost Semiconductor Manufacturing by Removing Tax Barriers—Not Creating Tax Subsidies
June 18, 2021
Erica York
A bipartisan group of Senators introduced the Facilitating American-Built Semiconductors (FABS) Act this week to create a permanent 25 percent investment tax credit for investments in semiconductor manufacturing equipment and construction of related facilities—but their proposal would not address underlying bias against investment that exists in the tax code today. Rather than provide industry-specific tax subsidies, lawmakers should make sure the basic structure of the tax code is not tilted against domestic investment generally.
The FABS Act would provide firms a tax credit (or a direct payment) equal to 25 percent of their qualified investment in semiconductor manufacturing facilities and property, reducing a firm’s tax liability and decreasing the after-tax cost of making such investments. However, the bill would leave the current depreciation system unchanged, meaning businesses would have to deduct the costs of building new facilities over extended periods, a delay that diminishes the real value of the deductions due to inflation and the time value of money.
Semiconductor manufacturing facilities, called “foundries,” and the related manufacturing equipment are extremely expensive to build. For example, Samsung is considering a $17 billion foundry in Austin, Texas, and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company is constructing an almost $20 billion foundry in southern Taiwan. The bill text itself emphasizes that a building and its structural components are “an integral part of a semiconductor manufacturing facility.”
Under current law, investment in industrial factories, such as a semiconductor foundry, cannot be deducted immediately but instead must be deducted over a 39-year period. The tax treatment of short-lived assets, such as some of the machinery and equipment that would go inside a foundry, is currently eligible for 100 percent bonus depreciation. That provision allows full write-offs in the year an asset is placed in service, but it will begin phasing out in 2023. Research and development expenses, also crucial to the semiconductor industry, are currently eligible for full expensing, but beginning next year will instead be amortized over five years.
If a business builds a foundry, it would not be able to fully deduct the cost of its investment, increasing the after-tax cost of the project. In 2021, structures such as industrial factories face a marginal effective tax rate of 21 percent, compared to 7.5 percent for equipment. By 2030, the rates will rise to 25.6 percent and 23.7 percent, under current law.
Attracting investment to the United States should start with neutral tax treatment, including full and immediate deductions for capital investment, not subsidies. By denying full and immediate deductions for investments, the tax code increases the cost of making such investments in the first place. Removing the tax code’s bias against making a domestic investment of any sort should be prioritized above exploring industry-specific tax subsidies.

Synopsis
Prime Minister Narendra Modi joined US President Joe Biden, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison in calling for ""close cooperation on supply chains with allies and partners who share our values"" with an aim to enhancing ""security and prosperity"" of the four partner nations and to ""strengthen capacity to respond to international disasters and emergencies"".

Several nations, including China, Japan and the US, are racing to build significant domestic capacity. India, for the third time in two decades, is attempting to build local semiconductor manufacturing capabilities.
The Quad Alliance - India, US, Japan, and Australia - has joined hands to secure supply chains in critical areas such as semiconductors and 5G telecom technologies, in a bid to contain the rising influence of China in these strategic sectors, according to geopolitical experts.

""Resilient, diverse and secure technology supply chains - for hardware, software and services - are vital to our shared national interests,"" the US said in a statement during the first-ever in-person summit of Quad leaders in Washington on Friday.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi joined US President Joe Biden, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison in calling for ""close cooperation on supply chains with allies and partners who share our values"" with an aim to enhancing ""security and prosperity"" of the four partner nations and to ""strengthen capacity to respond to international disasters and emergencies"".

The agreement comes at a time when there is a global shortage of semiconductors.

Positive for India
Several nations, including China, Japan and the US, are racing to build significant domestic capacity. India, for the third time in two decades, is attempting to build local semiconductor manufacturing capabilities by offering incentives to global firms to set up fabrication units in the country that can be used to supply silicon chips both to the local market as well as become a base for global supplies.

""This (the Quad agreement) is very positive for India. Multilateral cooperation on semiconductors is the only way, as self-sufficiency has not yielded results,"" said Pranay Kotasthane, who specialises in high-tech geopolitics as deputy director at The Takshashila Institution, a Bengaluru-based think tank.

Modi, who met Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon in Washington DC this week, asked the American company to step up its India investments in areas such as chips used in 5G telecom networks. Globally, Taiwan dominates the worldwide semiconductor manufacturing arena. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, its flagship company, is also the world's largest producer for over half of the globe's semiconductor requirements including advanced 5 nanometer chips. It plans to make 3 nanometer chips later this year.

The Quad's focus on securing high-tech supply chains is also due to this global dependency on Taiwan, which has a strained relationship with China, Kotasthane said. ""China has been violating Taiwanese air space and there have been cyber-attacks on Taiwan. These are risks and it can lead to supply chain bottlenecks. We already see it in the automotive industry. Collectively, Quad wants to rejig the supply chain and ensure the adversary doesn't have key controls of the supply chain,"" he said.


Quad framework
The four leaders have also jointly agreed on a framework of Quad principles that will drive the future of technology design, development, governance, and use. The Quad is also focused on fostering and promoting a diverse, resilient, and secure telecommunications ecosystem, it said.

Don't buy from China buy from US. China is dominating/hegemonizing the world not the US. How foolish can Indians be. Do you need QUAD to constrain China's growth so that so that US can continue to dominate world economy. India has to join QUAD because it serves US interests. Are we a foolish people?

Our theme on Stocks That Benefit From The Semiconductor Shortage, which includes companies that produce machinery and tools for chipmaking and semiconductor players with their own fab capacity, has returned about 26% year-to-date, outperforming the Nasdaq-100 which has returned about 15% over the same period.
While auto companies continue to face the brunt of the shortage, with auto majors such as Toyota Motors and Ford scaling back on production, even consumer electronics behemoth, Apple, which is known for its robust supply chain planning, is apparently seeing shortages of chips for products such as its MacBook laptops, Beats earphones, and Apple Watches. Now although it is difficult to ascertain the full extent of the semiconductor supply-demand imbalance, given the heterogeneous and secretive nature of the semiconductor business and the likely hoarding of chips by some customers, the general consensus is that the shortage will persist at least until mid-2022.
The longer-term outlook for companies in the foundry and semiconductor equipment space is poised to brighten even after the shortage issue is resolved. Trends such as higher digitization following Covid-19, the 5G upgrade cycle in the wireless market, and the need for more advanced chips for applications such as AI and machine learning, and cloud computing are big levers of semiconductor demand growth. Semiconductor content in automobiles is also expected to rise considerably in the coming years. For instance, Intel projects that chips will account for more than 20% of the input costs for new premium cars by 2030, up from about 4% in 2019.
Within our theme, Brooks Automation - a company that provides automation, vacuum, and instrumentation equipment for multiple markets, including semiconductor manufacturing, has been the strongest performer, with its stock price up by 55% year to date. On the other side, memory major Micron Technology has been the weakest performer, with its stock down by about 3%, due to a weak outlook for the memory markets.

What Is a Deferred Annuity?
ByDavid RodeckContributor
Firstly, the global semiconductor shortage may be far from over, causing companies to increase investment in production capacity. While there were signs that the semiconductor shortage in the automotive industry was easing earlier this summer, as major foundry players such as Taiwan’s TSMC noted that auto chip output was slated to increase, recent reports from automakers don’t sound as optimistic. Toyota Motors, the world’s largest car manufacturer by volume, is likely to cut global production in September by 40% from its previous plan due to the semiconductor supply crunch, per a report from Nikkei. Volkswagen also may need to further cut its production, while Ford is expected to idle production for one week at a U.S. plant that manufacturers its popular F-150 trucks, on account of the shortage. The consumer electronics industry is also now feeling the pinch, with Apple indicating that the production of its products such as the iPhone and iPad could be impacted by tight chip supply.
Semiconductor demand is also likely to trend higher in the long run. Higher digitization following Covid-19, the 5G upgrade cycle in the wireless market, and the need for more advanced chips for applications such as AI and machine learning, and cloud computing are big levers of semiconductor demand growth. This should also bode well for equipment manufacturers, who could see demand for more cutting-edge chip production tools.
Within our theme, Applied Materials has been the strongest performer, with its stock rising by about 50% year-to-date. On the other side, memory major Micron Technology has been the worst performer, with its stock down 6.5% year-to-date.
[7/19/2021] With Auto Chip Shortage Easing, Are Semiconductor Equipment Stocks Still A Buy?
Our theme on Stocks That Benefit From The Semiconductor Shortage includes companies that produce machinery and tools for chipmaking and semiconductor players with their own fab capacity. The stocks in the theme have had a relatively mixed couple of days, driven by news from TSMC, the largest semiconductor contract manufacturer, which indicated that the automotive chip shortage was likely to ease this quarter as it plans to increase the output of semiconductors that go into vehicles by almost 60% versus last year and by roughly 30% from pre-pandemic levels. However, there are several trends that point to structurally higher semiconductor demand, which should, in turn, drive investments in chip fabrication equipment. Higher digitization following Covid-19, the 5G upgrade cycle in the wireless market, and the need for more advanced chips for applications such as AI and machine learning, and cloud computing are big levers of semiconductor demand growth. Separately, the demand for increasing re-shoring of semiconductor production to the U.S. from overseas could also drive sales.
Our theme has outperformed this year, returning 21% year-to-date, compared to a return of 14% for the Nasdaq-100. Within our theme, Applied Materials has been the strongest performer, with its stock rising by about 49% year-to-date. On the other side, memory major Micron Technology has been the worst performer, with its stock remaining roughly flat year-to-date.
[7/7/2021] Semiconductor Shortage Stocks
The global chip supply crunch has disrupted production in a wide range of industries. Although much of the news about the shortage has been centered on the automotive industry, industries ranging from medical devices to home appliances and consumer electronics continue to see the impact. There doesn’t appear to be a quick solution to the current shortage, and considerable investments into the global semiconductor supply chain will be required in the coming years. Investors can gain exposure to this trend via our indicative theme on Stocks That Benefit From The Semiconductor Shortage - which includes companies that produce machinery and tools for chipmaking and semiconductor players with their own fab capacity. The theme has outperformed this year, returning 27% year-to-date, compared to a return of 16% for the Nasdaq-100. Within our theme, Applied Materials has been the strongest performer, with its stock rising by about 58% year-to-date as investors expect the company, which supplies wafer fab equipment, to be a key beneficiary of rising capital spending by chipmakers. On the other side, memory major Micron Technology has been the worst performer, with its stock price up by just about 7% this year.
[6/21/2021] Stocks That Benefit As U.S. Re-Shores Semiconductor Production
The global chip shortage, which was brought about by surging demand from the consumer electronics industry and supply-side disruptions, has impacted the production of a range of products ranging from cars to computers over the last few quarters. Investors can stand to benefit from the trend, with our indicative theme on Stocks That Benefit From The Semiconductor Shortage - which includes companies that produce machinery and tools for chipmaking and semiconductor players with their own fab capacity. The theme has outperformed this year, returning 23% year-to-date, compared to a return of 11% for the S&P 500.
Now, although the worst of the semiconductor crunch appears to be over for the automotive industry - which bore the brunt of the disruption, we think the theme will continue to outperform in the medium to long term as semiconductor demand is expected to run ahead of supply. Moreover, demand for semiconductor fabrication equipment is also likely to grow, as the U.S. government has been taking steps to protect its chip supply by incentivizing domestic production following the current supply crunch, as well as events such as Covid-19, and the trade war with China. For perspective, the U.S. share of semiconductors production has declined to just 12% down from about 37% share back in 1990 and lawmakers are looking to reverse this trend. Last week, lawmakers introduced a bipartisan bill looking at a 25% tax credit for investments into semiconductor manufacturing equipment and facilities to encourage semiconductor companies to invest in U.S. production. This comes less than a week after the Senate approved about $52 billion in funding for the semiconductor industry, to help the U.S. better take on China.
Within our theme, Applied Materials -a supplier of equipment, services, and software used in the production of semiconductor and display products - has been the strongest performer, with its stock price up by 52% year to date. On the other side, memory major Micron Technology has been the weakest performer, with its stock up by just about 2%.
[6/7/2021] Chip Shortage Stocks
Our theme on Stocks That Benefit From The Semiconductor Shortage - which includes chip companies with their own fabrication capacity and companies that produce machinery and tools for chipmaking - has outperformed this year, returning 30% year-to-date, compared to a return of 13% for the S&P 500. Now although there are some signs that the shortage is easing a bit for the auto sector, with carmakers restarting some production lines they had previously idled, it’s safe to assume that demand for chips will continue to outstrip supply across the board, in the medium term. For example, the CEO of Intel, Pat Gelsinger, expects the shortage to last another two years. There are some other trends that could help the stocks in our theme. Western countries are looking to become more self-reliant with respect to semiconductor production, which is presently dominated by China and other countries in Asia, and this could boost demand for chip fabrication equipment. President Joe Biden’s infrastructure plan also includes $50 billion worth of subsidies for the semiconductor industry and this could also help bolster demand for fabrication equipment.
Within our theme, Applied Materials -a supplier of equipment, services, and software used in the production of semiconductor and display products - has been the strongest performer, with its stock price up by 62% year to date. On the other side, memory major Micron Technology has been the weakest performer, with its stock up by just about 11%.
[5/12/2021]
Our theme on Stocks That Benefit From The Semiconductor Shortage has returned 28% year-to-date, compared to a return of 13% for the S&P 500. The current chip shortage has gotten more severe over the last few weeks, spreading from the automotive industry which typically relies on legacy, lower margin chips, to more advanced chips used in areas such as consumer electronics. For instance, Apple recently hinted that sales of some of its iPads and Macs could be impacted in the coming quarters by the shortage of chips, while Samsung says that the supply crunch is impacting its television and appliance production.
Within our theme, companies that provide tools and machinery for chipmaking have performed the best this year. Investors expect that the current chip shortage and increasing push by the U.S. and the European Union to become more self-reliant with semiconductor production (which is currently dominated by China) is likely to boost demand for chip fabrication equipment. For instance, Applied Materials, Brooks Automation, and LAM Research have seen year-to-date returns of 53%, 35%, and 30% respectively. Semiconductor companies with their own fabrication capacity – which are also part of our theme – have also fared reasonably well with Micron Technology stock up 20%, Intel up 18%, and Skyworks Solutions up 15%. These companies should stand to benefit, to an extent, from the strong demand and price dynamics in the current market, while being somewhat insulated from the supply side constraints.
[4/29/2021] Stocks That Benefit From The Semiconductor Crunch
The semiconductor industry has been facing a severe supply crunch, driven by surging demand from the consumer electronics industry through Covid-19 and supply-side disruptions including a fire at a fabrication unit in Japan, the freezing weather in the southern United States, and drought in Taiwan. The auto industry is bearing the brunt of the shortfall, with OEMs including Toyota, Volkswagen, and GM having to scale back on production due to a lack of chips, and consumer electronics majors such as Apple are also beginning to feel the pinch. That said, there are a set of companies that stand to benefit from the current shortfall in chip production. For example, semiconductor players who have their own fab capacity stand to gain, as they could see higher price realization without seeing their costs escalate. Moreover, companies that produce tools and machinery for chipmaking should also benefit, as chipmakers expand budgets in order to add more production capacity. For example, Taiwan’s TSMC said it will spend about $100 billion over the next three years to boost capacity, while Samsung Electronics plans to invest $116 billion into boosting production by 2030. Our theme on Stocks That Benefit From The Semiconductor Shortage has returned 32% year-to-date, compared to a return of 12% for the S&P 500. Below is a bit more about some of the stocks in our theme and how they have been performing this year.
Applied Materials supplies equipment, services, and software used in the production of semiconductor and display products. The stock has been the strongest performer within our theme, rising about 56% year-to-date, driven by strong demand for semiconductor equipment, and increasing production complexity in the industry.
Brooks Automation provides automation, vacuum, and instrumentation equipment for markets including the semiconductor and life sciences industry. The stock is up by about 46% year-to-date as the company is seeing higher demand for its products from the semiconductor space driven by the trends such as the Internet of Things, 5G wireless technology, and machine learning.
KLA Tencor is another supplier to the semiconductor production space, focused on process control and yield management solutions. The stock is up by about 25% year-to-date, driven by the current chip shortage, and calls from the U.S. government to strengthen the American semiconductor manufacturing industry.
Intel, one of the largest microprocessor makers, is also likely to benefit from the current supply crunch as it operates its own fabs, unlike rivals such as AMD and Qualcomm who are dependent on third parties. The company also recently indicated that it was in talks with companies that design chips for carmakers to produce their chips at Intel foundries. The stock is up 18% this year.

Quantum Monte Carlo at Exascale Could Be Key to Finding New Semiconductor Materials
By Linda Barney
September 27, 2021
Researchers are urgently trying to identify possible materials to replace silicon-based semiconductors. The processing power in modern computers continues to increase even as the size of the silicon on which components are placed shrinks. The silicon chip size continues to decrease from 14 nanometers (nm) to 10nm, to 7nm and even smaller. The laws of physics suggest that there is a limit to the number of transistors that can fit on silicon-based chips. As this limit is reached, processing gains will decrease and there will be electron interactions between the components on the chip.
This is one of the research challenges being pursued by scientists preparing for the upcoming Intel-HPE exascale supercomputer, Aurora, which will be housed at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory. Supported by the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility’s (ALCF) Aurora Early Science Program, an Argonne team is performing Quantum Monte Carlo research to help locate a new material that could replace silicon-based semiconductors. ALCF computational scientist Anouar Benali is the Primary Investigator on the project.
Anouar Benali
Benali explains, “The search for the next semiconductor material will require high-performance computers (HPC) at exascale. Simulations can only be done on very small prototypes of semiconductor materials with current supercomputers. Using an exascale supercomputer, such as the future Aurora system, will allow us to expand simulations of more materials to help find a viable semiconductor material. Our team is also working with ALCF and the Intel Parallel Computing Center in modifying codes to run on the Aurora supercomputer. We have already seen a 20x processing speedup on the ALCF’s Theta supercomputer, which will allow us to run larger and more realistic compounds in our search for a new semiconductor material.”
What is Quantum Monte Carlo?
The Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculation is a quantum calculation that provides some of the most accurate solutions to quantum mechanical problems. QMC provides theoretical predictions for many problems at the forefront of research—from materials science to complex biological systems. The main power of the QMC method is that instead of trying to solve analytically the Schrödinger equation, describing and predicting all interactions in nature, QMC generates millions of random solutions. QMC then accepts all the solutions that solve the equation or rejects all the ones that don’t to save research time and improve prediction accuracy.

Semiconductor Quantum Chemistry Research
Predicting the properties of materials, or designing materials based on desired properties, is one of the most important goals of material science simulations. Benali states, “Most of the phenomena driving these properties occur at very small scales that are ruled by the laws of quantum mechanics.” For example, knowing if a material will be a good semiconductor or fine tuning the composition of a material to generate the perfect semiconductor requires solving the many-body problem of interacting particles in a quantum system. Researchers often use density functional theory (DFT) equations for organic molecules to determine the properties of a many-electron system. DFT simulations are less computationally expensive than QMC, but the predictions are not as accurate.
Benali’s team developed the open-source simulation code QMCPACK, software which contains Monte Carlo algorithms and uses the Schrödinger equation in calculations. Benali explains, “By solving the Schrödinger equation using statistical methods, large and complex systems can be studied to unprecedented accuracy—including systems where other electronic structure methods have difficulty. The Schrödinger equation can predict all behavior of almost everything in the universe. However, solving the equation for a system as small as a hydrogen molecule is impossible without a significant number of approximations using computer simulations. When simulating properties of more complex materials such as semiconductors, the number of approximations becomes significant, with a tradeoff of a loss of accuracy.”
“The team can significantly reduce the number of quantum approximations that can be simulated using an exascale system such as the future Aurora supercomputer. Using an exascale system will allow us to run calculations on larger systems as well as increase the accuracy of the simulation result to help identify a new semiconductor material to replace silicon-based semiconductors,” states Benali.
Scientific Case Study
The team’s research involves searching for a substitute for silicon (Si) complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) based computing materials. In locating a suitable material to replace silicon, the team must address a fundamental materials problem that current can leak through a hafnium(IV) oxide (HfO2) gate dielectric. Hafnium is used in optical coatings, and as a high-κ dielectric in Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM) capacitors and in advanced metal-oxide-semiconductor devices. Researchers have found evidence that impurities like nitrogen and fluorine are able to reduce leakage currents. However, current computational studies are limited to DFT which do not provide the necessary accuracy to test this theory.
The team is using QMCPACK software to study the energetics of point defects near a HfO2 interface. QMCPACK is funded by the DOE Exascale Comupting Project. Due to the large number of electrons in these simulations, calculations can only be made possible by the large aggregate memory and performance offered by an exascale system such as the future Aurora supercomputer. Benali states, “Our research seeks to prove that adding the right amount of the right impurities can enable the properties we are looking for in the next generation of semiconductors. But mostly, our research is trying to demonstrate that with enough computer power, quantum simulations can be fully predictive and provide significant support to experimental research.”

Reducing Calculations with Future Exascale Supercomputers
Increased compute power enables the research team to use QMC to significantly reduce the number of approximations in the resolution of the Schrödinger equation. “The more solutions we try, the more accurate our results become. The greatest value of using the Monte Carlo approach resides in the fact that each random solution is independent from another, meaning that the resolution can be distributed on as many processing units as are available,” indicates Benali.
How Long Does Semiconductor Research Take?
If the accuracy of the answer requires simulating one million random solutions and simulating one solution takes one second on one processing unit, the team’s simulation will end in one million seconds (277 days). However, because the evaluations of the random solutions are independent, on a machine like Argonne’s Theta supercomputer, the evaluation takes about 3.55 seconds. In a more realistic simulation, some operations of initialization and collection of data cannot be parallelized and increase the cost of the computation, but overall the method remains extremely parallel.

Updating QMCPACK Software: Exascale Systems Require a New Approach to Software
The open-source QMCPACK code used by the team in their in the semiconductor research is maintained by Argonne National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and several universities. Benali is one of the co-owners and co-developers of QMCPACK. Intel has been working with this group since 2016 and provides access to multiple experimental computer systems along with tools such as the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL) and Intel compilers. The ALCF team maintains the software and code stacks on test machines. In addition, ALCF staff aids researchers in creating or modifying code so that it performs the desired chemistry functions and is designed to run on the future Aurora exascale system.
Coding software for an exascale system requires a new approach to software design and coding. Hardware on an exascale system is not a heterogenous system. In an exascale system, there is not one single Central Processing Unit (CPU) but many components such as CPUs, Graphic Processing Units (GPUs), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), or expanded memory that performs different tasks. The team is breaking the program functions into various modules that perform calculations for a component such as a CPU, multiple CPUs, a GPU as well as calculations based on memory. Coding for an exascale system requires that the programmer is more aware of the varied architecture of the system when writing code. In addition, the team’s semiconductor research can do millions of simulations that are running completely separately. So modifying QMCPACK code to optimize running on GPUs is a priority.
Challenges for Future Quantum Materials Research
“In our current research, our team uses quantum material science simulations to try to predict the behavior and structure of materials to help locate a suitable material to replace silicon in semiconductors. Our team uses QMCPACK on large scale HPC in our quantum chemistry research. “With the advent of the exascale era, a machine like Aurora will allow simulating more realistic and complex materials, replicating what experimentalists do in-situ. Such leaps will allow to orders of magnitude speed up in the pace of discoveries” indicates Benali.
The ALCF is a DOE Office of Science User Facility. Primary support for QMCPACK is via the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division, as part of the Computational Materials Sciences Program and Center for Predictive Simulation of Functional Materials, and also the Exascale Computing Project (17-SC-20-SC), a collaborative effort of the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science and the National Nuclear Security Administration.

New Research Center Focuses on Semiconductor Security
By Kim Horner | July 16, 2021
UT Dallas is part of a National Science Foundation-funded university consortium to protect computer hardware, including circuit boards and semiconductors, from cyberattacks.
Just as computer networks can be susceptible to cyberattacks, semiconductor chips also can be vulnerable to tampering in ways that could compromise the safety of cars, airplanes, electric grids, defense systems — any of the growing number of technologies that depend on these tiny electronic components.
To address this risk, The University of Texas at Dallas, along with five other universities, has established the Center for Hardware and Embedded Systems Security and Trust (CHEST), a new research center focused on protecting the security of semiconductors, the circuit boards they are mounted on and other computer hardware. Led by the University of Cincinnati, CHEST also involves Northeastern University; University of California, Davis; University of Connecticut; and the University of Virginia.
CHEST is a National Science Foundation (NSF) Industry-University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) that serves as a hub for industry-focused research and currently comprises 23 members across industry and governmental laboratories.
Dr. Yiorgos Makris, professor of electrical and computer engineering in the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science, received a $750,000, five-year NSF grant in 2019 to launch the UT Dallas CHEST site, which opened in 2020. The center also provides opportunities for University faculty and students to conduct research for other federal agencies. So far, UT Dallas researchers have received $705,000 for research projects in the first two years.
“Increasingly, hardware can be the entry point for a cyberattack,” said Makris, who directs the UT Dallas CHEST effort. “That’s why it is so important for researchers, industry, and national and federal laboratories to work together to develop solutions. We are excited to be part of such a collaborative effort through CHEST.”
The overall investment in CHEST exceeds $13 million, including equal NSF funds for each university and dues from Industrial Advisory Board members. Congress included $3 million for the center through the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act.
UT Dallas leads the consortium’s research on the security and trust of wireless communication devices, threat detection and prevention, protection of intellectual property from unauthorized use, and provenance attestation, which involves a record that describes entities and processes involved in producing the devices.
Semiconductor chips — often referred to as simply semiconductors — make it possible for electronic devices to process, store and transmit data. Most semiconductors are composed of sets of integrated electronic circuits layered on a thin wafer of semiconductor material in an area as small as a few square millimeters.
“Increasingly, hardware can be the entry point for a cyberattack. That’s why it is so important for researchers, industry, and national and federal laboratories to work together to develop solutions. We are excited to be part of such a collaborative effort through CHEST.”
Dr. Yiorgos Makris, professor of electrical and computer engineering in the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science
As the use of electronic devices grows, their components have become increasingly vulnerable to malicious tampering and counterfeiting. As an example, Makris described a scenario of how tampering could affect the electronics that control critical infrastructure such as the power grid.
“Suppose a bad actor replaces a chip during a service or upgrade, enabling capabilities that can cause the power distribution network to fail,” Makris said. “Semiconductor tampering also has implications for consumer electronics, such as wireless communication devices, where private data may be leaked by untrusted chips, or the automotive industry, where safety may be compromised by counterfeit parts.”
The global shortage of semiconductors increases the risk of the use of counterfeit parts, Makris said.
“The semiconductor shortage does not just affect productivity and the ability of industry to keep producing cars, phones and consumer electronics,” he said. “The situation also has deeper security implications as desperate suppliers or consumers turn to the gray market to find parts.”
While the U.S. is a leader in semiconductor design, most of the manufacturing has shifted progressively out of the country over the past 30 years, leaving the U.S. vulnerable to supply chain disruptions out of its control, according to an April 2021 study by the Semiconductor Industry Association. The U.S. Senate recently approved legislation called the United States Innovation and Competition Act of 2021, which in part would provide $52 billion to incentivize domestic semiconductor manufacturing.
Companies that design the chips potentially can lose control of what happens to their intellectual property during the manufacturing process, Makris said.
“You don’t want an adversary to get access to the chip blueprint,” Makris said. “Otherwise, you may lose control of your competitive edge.”
Makris joined UT Dallas in 2011 after more than 10 years as a faculty member at Yale University. To help ensure the trustworthiness of chips, Makris and his research group have pioneered techniques that use machine learning and statistical and formal methods to discover malicious capabilities, detect counterfeits and attest the facility wherein chips were manufactured.
In addition to his role as CHEST site director, Makris leads the safety, security and health care thrust of the Texas Analog Center of Excellence and is director of the Trusted and RELiable Architectures Research laboratory, both at UT Dallas.

O’Mara joins Michal Lev-Ram and Brian O’Keefe, the hosts of Fortune Brainstorm, to discuss the history of semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S., how it’s since moved offshore, and why the government should invest not only in domestic plants and manufacturing, but also in people and ideas to support innovation and the broader growth of the American tech sector.
Also on the show, Lev-Ram talks to Ondrej Burkacky, who studies the global semiconductor industry as a consultant at McKinsey & Company. Burkacky explains why big tech companies can’t just start manufacturing semiconductors domestically to account for the shortage. He also describes the challenges that come along with trying to accurately forecast semiconductor demand, especially during a pandemic.
O’Keefe later interviews Tyson Tuttle, CEO of Silicon Labs, a global semiconductor company based in Austin, Texas. Tuttle says he believes that the demand for semiconductors will continue to increase, referencing American-based companies such as Tesla, Apple, and Amazon, all of which are now designing their own chips. 
Whether it’s “autonomous driving, in the case of Tesla, or higher-speed data centers that are going into some of the large companies,” Tuttle says, such cutting-edge technology has prompted U.S.-based companies to expand over the last five years. Tuttle says he remains optimistic about the United States’s position as a leader in the industry.

SoftBank And Arm’s Five-Year, $54 Billion Semiconductor Saga Is Nearing Its Finale
Kevin DowdForbes Staff
Money
I write about buyouts, mergers, acquisitions and other dealmaking.
This is an excerpt from Deal Flow, Forbes’ daily newsletter about big buyouts, big mergers and the rest of Big Finance. Want a new edition in your inbox every afternoon? Subscribe here.
Over the past few years, the semiconductor sector has been beset by mega-mergers. A half-dozen different deals in the space worth at least $10 billion have gone on the books since the start of 2020. And with industry giants such as Intel actively hunting for takeover targets, there's no end in sight to all that consolidation.
The biggest deal of the past couple years came early last fall, when Nvidia agreed to acquire Arm from SoftBank in a move then worth $40 billion. Since then, though, the planned combination has become mired in regulatory muck. It's still unclear whether Nvidia will be allowed to proceed with its industry-shaking takeover.
But we could be on the brink of a significant development in the saga. And as it so happens, today is the five-year anniversary of the day when Arm officially entered SoftBank ownership. So it seemed like an appropriate time to hop in our Takeover Time Machine™ and look back on how Arm, SoftBank and Nvidia got to where they are today—and at what might come next for a deal that keeps getting bigger with each passing month.
Masayoshi Son and SoftBank are trying to cash in their bet on Arm—but regulators might have other ideas. GETTY IMAGES
Arm was founded in 1990 as a joint venture between Apple, Acorn Computers and VLSI Technology to research and develop microprocessors for special types of machines known as reduced instruction set computers, or RISCs. (The name Arm is an acronym for Advanced RISC Machines.) The venture proved extremely successful. Today, Arm owns the intellectual property that underlies much of the global consumer tech industry. Its licensed technology powers chips made by companies such as Qualcomm and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing that are then used in smartphones, tablets, smart TVs and other products from the likes of Apple, Samsung and Huawei.
When the company went public in 1998 through simultaneous listings in the U.S. and London, it was an immediate hit. Arm shares climbed nearly 50% on their first day of trading, taking its market cap north of $1 billion.
Over the ensuing years, Arm continued to grow—mainly through organic means of building its existing business, but also through several smaller instances of M&A. The U.K.-based company's biggest acquisition came in 2004, when it bought chip component maker Artisan Components for $913 million. After nearly two decades as a standalone public company, Arm then became an M&A target of its own: In July 2016, SoftBank agreed to buy the company for £23.4 billion, or about $32 billion at the time. The deal was finalized a few months later, on Sept. 5, 2016.
SoftBank is no stranger to making huge bets on companies at the nexus of worldwide technological shifts. Led by founder Masayoshi Son, the Japanese company first rose to prominence in the late 1990s as an early investor in digital pioneers Yahoo and Alibaba. Son has previously said that, for one three-day stretch amid the peak of the dot-com bubble, he was the richest man in the world. Before long, though, that bubble burst. SoftBank cratered, and Son has spent the past two decades trying to build a new, sturdier version of a tech investing colossus.
In 2017, SoftBank launched the Vision Fund. It was the biggest investing vehicle anyone in venture capital had ever seen: Some $100 billion dollars, a large chunk of it provided by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, a previously unimaginable pool of capital which SoftBank and Son quickly went to work deploying. The Vision Fund began to pump huge sums of capital into young startups from around the world to foster immediate growth, taking the idea of blitzscaling to the extreme and creating new unicorns at a breakneck pace. Powerhouses like WeWork, Uber, Grab, Compass, DoorDash, Coupang and ByteDance make up just a small sample of Son's eventual portfolio.
The same year the vehicle launched, SoftBank transferred a 25% stake in Arm into its Vision Fund. A year later, in 2018, it sold a 51% stake in Arm Technology China to a group that included Chinese investors such as Hopu Investments, Silk Road Fund and the state-owned China Investment Corporation. In the years since, Arm and those investors have tussled over who actually controls the Chinese subsidiary. When Arm tried to oust the unit's leader, Allen Wu, over allegations that his personal investment fund created a conflict of interest, Wu refused to leave, launching a power struggle that has yet to be publicly resolved.
On the whole, though, Arm continued to thrive under SoftBank's ownership, buoyed by the global currents that have made semiconductors of all kinds an increasingly critical part of daily life. When SoftBank began searching for an exit, it didn't take long to find a buyer. On Sept. 13, 2020, chipmaker Nvidia agreed to buy Arm in a cash-and-stock deal that, at the time was worth $40 billion. With Nvidia's stock price soaring over the past year as the proposed deal has simmered under regulatory review, the true value of the transaction is now pegged at closer to $54 billion.
Nvidia was founded not long after Arm, in 1993. With early backing from venture firms including Sequoia, the company focused on building graphics processing units for video games. Since then, the utility of such GPUs has expanded—and so have the rest of Nvidia's product offerings. It still makes chips for gamers, but the California-based company also builds products for super computers, smartphones and more. With a market cap of more than $500 billion, it's one of the most powerful companies in the semiconductor industry, competing with names like Intel, Qualcomm and Advanced Micro Devices.
So why have British regulators raised concerns about Nvidia's planned acquisition of Arm? The primary answers are in those past two paragraphs. Arm owns patents for semiconductor technology that is, as I wrote, an increasingly critical part of daily life. And Nvidia is one of a few biggest companies that uses that technology to make its own chips. If Nvidia were to own Arm outright, it would create the possibility that Arm might stop selling or licensing its technology to the Intels and the AMDs of the world, smothering competition in an industry where competition has long been seen as key to fostering new innovation.
The U.K. has also raised questions about the national security implications of the deal—a sign of how integral the semiconductor industry has become in the realms of war and national defense.
For many months now, the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority had been looking into whether the takeover would be harmful to competition. Two weeks ago, it published an initial 10-page report concluding the acquisition would indeed ""lead to a realistic prospect of a substantial lessening of competition, and consequently to a stifling of innovation, and more expensive or lower quality products."" Nvidia proposed certain unspecified remedies to address those concerns, but the CMA was unenthused. On deck now is a more in-depth investigation into the deal's potential implications.
And the CMA might not be the only body taking a closer look. The Financial Times reported late last week that the European Commission is planning to launch a formal probe of its own to examine competition concerns raised by the Nvidia-Arm deal, with the investigation set to begin as soon as this week.
After nearly a year of waiting around, Nvidia, Arm and SoftBank are finally getting some answers about whether they will be able to consummate a merger that, in some ways, has been three decades in the making. That's the good news. The bad news is that, so far, those answers are not to their liking.

The U.S. and European Union pledged Wednesday to deepen its alliance for the sake of advancing common priorities like artificial intelligence, trade challenges and the ""underpin"" to global economies: semiconductors.
""Semiconductors are the material basis for integrated circuits that are essential to modern-day life and underpin our economies,"" U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council said in a joint statement. ""As such, semiconductors power virtually every sector of the economy, including energy, healthcare, agriculture, consumer electronics, manufacturing, defense, and transportation.""
The council said the coronavirus pandemic highlighted the need to increase stable and reliable supply chains for the production of semiconductors.
CHINESE SWITCH TO FLASHLIGHTS, GENERATORS AMID POWER CUTS 
Chip shortages began under the Trump administration, when supply chains were affected by the trade war with China. But chip shortages were further exacerbated by an increased demand for electronics on everything from laptops to at-home health care during the pandemic. 
""We recognize that the semiconductor supply chain, from raw materials, design and manufacturing to assembly, testing and incorporation into end products, is extremely complex and geographically dispersed,"" the council said. ""The United States and European Union have some important respective strengths as well as ongoing, significant mutual dependencies, and common external dependencies.""
Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo traveled to Pittsburgh to meet with European Commission Executive Vice Presidents Valdis Dombrovskis and Margrethe Vestager to bolster ties, as relations between the U.S. and Europe have become strained.
EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton warned last week that there is a growing sense that the U.S.-trans Atlantic relationship is ""broken"" and suggested it was time to ""pause and reset"" the partnership.
Breton’s comments came after France was sidelined in a U.S.-U.K. deal with Australia that effectively voided an existing submarine contract with the EU nation. 
The commissioner was not present for Wednesday’s council meeting in Pittsburgh, but his social media suggested Breton was working to extend the EU's reach into the global chip market.
On Wednesday Breton announced on Twitter he was in Japan facilitating an EU-Japan ""cooperation"" and preparing the ""ground for our upcoming EU Chip Act.""
The U.S. similarly has looked to strengthen this alliance with Japan and bolster semiconductor production. 
The joint U.S.-EU interest in Japan could signal an increased push to distance themselves from China.

The council pledged to ""stand together"" against ""unfair behavior of state-owned enterprises,"" though the statement did not directly identify China. 
""We intend to focus on reducing existing strategic dependencies throughout the supply chain, especially through a diversification of the supply chain and increased investment,"" the council said, adding they will ""work jointly so that any investment made on our territories is done in full respect of our respective security of supply.""

“Spiked” Semiconductors for Clean Hydrogen Production

Hydrogen fuel is often touted as a clean energy source, with water vapor as its only emission. But often hydrogen is created by heating steam and methane, a process that itself produces carbon dioxide emissions. Sunlight-driven methods don’t add carbon emissions—but they’ve been expensive and inefficient to implement.
That reportedly could change with an improved semiconductor device that uses sunlight to split oxygen off water molecules (Nat. Commun., doi: 10.1038/s41467-021-24229-y). “The devices we’ve demonstrated,” according to Edward Yu of the University of Texas, Austin, USA, a coauthor on the new work, “can be fabricated using low-cost materials and processes that are already widely used in manufacturing of semiconductor electronics, and provide excellent stability under operation.”
Silicon–water dilemmas
Solar water splitting is typically performed with photoelectrochemical cells, which are not unlike solar cells. These cells use semiconductor materials to absorb photons and create free electrons and holes, which are essential to energizing and splitting the water molecules.
Photoelectrochemical cells are immersed in water, so it’s necessary for them to be durable. Since silicon degrades in the presence of water-splitting reactions, photoelectrodes are often coated with an insulating protective layer. These layers, though, can reduce efficiency by blocking the flow of electrons and holes between the photoelectrode and the water.
Spiked for success
In the new research, the scientists used a method called aluminum spiking, which involves coating the insulated semiconductor with aluminum and heating it to create nanoscale pathways through the insulator layer. The researchers then filled the pathways with nickel to form conductive bridges that improve the water-splitting efficiency and catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction, while maintaining the semiconductor’s durability.
The improved semiconductors focus on the oxygen evolution reaction in water splitting, whereby electrons are removed to form oxygen gas. Fully splitting water molecules also requires a hydrogen evolution reaction, to produce the hydrogen gas. The researchers plan to extend their findings to the hydrogen half of the equation next, as well as to continue improving efficiencies in the system.
Toward commercial use
The authors have filed a patent for the new technology and see it being commercialized in the future.
“The key processes involved in fabricating the types of devices we’ve demonstrated could be implemented in manufacturing very quickly,” Yu said. “Commercial viability will still require some improvements in certain aspects of the performance of these devices, and we have a number of approaches we’re exploring that we hope will enable these improvements to be realized.”

A peculiar state of matter in layers of semiconductors
In a study that could benefit quantum computing, researchers show a superlattice embedded with nanodots may be immune from dissipating energy to the environment.

The setup for the milli-electronvolt inelastic X-ray scattering that probes the many-body localization in the disordered superlattice system

Scientists around the world are developing new hardware for quantum computers, a new type of device that could accelerate drug design, financial modeling, and weather prediction. These computers rely on qubits, bits of matter that can represent some combination of 1 and 0 simultaneously. The problem is that qubits are fickle, degrading into regular bits when interactions with surrounding matter interfere. But new research at MIT suggests a way to protect their states, using a phenomenon called many-body localization (MBL).
MBL is a peculiar phase of matter, proposed decades ago, that is unlike solid or liquid. Typically, matter comes to thermal equilibrium with its environment. That’s why soup cools and ice cubes melt. But in MBL, an object consisting of many strongly interacting bodies, such as atoms, never reaches such equilibrium. Heat, like sound, consists of collective atomic vibrations and can travel in waves; an object always has such heat waves internally. But when there’s enough disorder and enough interaction in the way its atoms are arranged, the waves can become trapped, thus preventing the object from reaching equilibrium.
MBL had been demonstrated in “optical lattices,” arrangements of atoms at very cold temperatures held in place using lasers. But such setups are impractical. MBL had also arguably been shown in solid systems, but only with very slow temporal dynamics, in which the phase’s existence is hard to prove because equilibrium might be reached if researchers could wait long enough. The MIT research found a signatures of MBL in a “solid-state” system — one made of semiconductors — that would otherwise have reached equilibrium in the time it was watched.
“It could open a new chapter in the study of quantum dynamics,” says Rahul Nandkishore, a physicist at the University of Colorado at Boulder, who was not involved in the work.
Mingda Li, the Norman C Rasmussen Assistant Professor Nuclear Science and Engineering at MIT, led the new study, published in a recent issue of Nano Letters. The researchers built a system containing alternating semiconductor layers, creating a microscopic lasagna — aluminum arsenide, followed by gallium arsenide, and so on, for 600 layers, each 3 nanometers (millionths of a millimeter) thick. Between the layers they dispersed “nanodots,” 2-nanometer particles of erbium arsenide, to create disorder. The lasagna, or “superlattice,” came in three recipes: one with no nanodots, one in which nanodots covered 8 percent of each layer’s area, and one in which they covered 25 percent.
According to Li, the team used layers of material, instead of a bulk material, to simplify the system so dissipation of heat across the planes was essentially one-dimensional. And they used nanodots, instead of mere chemical impurities, to crank up the disorder.
To measure whether these disordered systems are still staying in equilibrium, the researchers measured them with X-rays. Using the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Lab, they shot beams of radiation at an energy of more than 20,000 electron volts, and to resolve the energy difference between the incoming X-ray and after its reflection off the sample’s surface, with an energy resolution less than one one-thousandth of an electron volt. To avoid penetrating the superlattice and hitting the underlying substrate, they shot it at an angle of just half a degree from parallel.
Just as light can be measured as waves or particles, so too can heat. The collective atomic vibration for heat in the form of a heat-carrying unit is called a phonon. X-rays interact with these phonons, and by measuring how X-rays reflect off the sample, the experimenters can determine if it is in equilibrium.
The researchers found that when the superlattice was cold — 30 kelvin, about -400 degrees Fahrenheit — and it contained nanodots, its phonons at certain frequencies remained were not in equilibrium.
More work remains to prove conclusively that MBL has been achieved, but “this new quantum phase can open up a whole new platform to explore quantum phenomena,” Li says, “with many potential applications, from thermal storage to quantum computing.”
To create qubits, some quantum computers employ specks of matter called quantum dots. Li says quantum dots similar to Li’s nanodots could act as qubits. Magnets could read or write their quantum states, while the many-body localization would keep them insulated from heat and other environmental factors.
In terms of thermal storage, such a superlattice might switch in and out of an MBL phase by magnetically controlling the nanodots. It could insulate computer parts from heat at one moment, then allow parts to disperse heat when it won’t cause damage. Or it could allow heat to build up and be harnessed later for generating electricity.
Conveniently, superlattices with nanodots can be constructed using traditional techniques for fabricating semiconductors, alongside other elements of computer chips. According to Li, “It’s a much larger design space than with chemical doping, and there are numerous applications.”
“I am excited to see that signatures of MBL can now also be found in real material systems,"" says Immanuel Bloch, scientific director at the Max-Planck-Institute of Quantum Optics, of the new work. “I believe this will help us to better understand the conditions under which MBL can be observed in different quantum many-body systems and how possible coupling to the environment affects the stability of the system. These are fundamental and important questions and the MIT experiment is an important step helping us to answer them.”

Semiconductor shortage that has hobbled manufacturing worldwide is getting worse
microchip integrated on motherboard
Jeanne Whalen, (c) 2021, The Washington Post

The global semiconductor shortage that has paralyzed automakers for nearly a year shows signs of worsening, as new coronavirus infections halt chip assembly lines in Southeast Asia, forcing more car companies and electronics manufacturers to suspend production.
A wave of delta-variant cases in Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines is causing production delays at factories that cut and package semiconductors, creating new bottlenecks on top of those caused by soaring demand for chips.

Underscoring that the problem has defied easy solutions, the White House on Thursday held its second summit in five months with semiconductor manufacturers and buyers, in part to gain more clarity on the scope of the crisis, senior administration officials said.
Attendees included senior executives from Intel, General Motors, Ford, Apple, Microsoft, Samsung and two dozen other companies, as well as Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese.
Frustration has mounted on all sides. Automakers want semiconductor companies to crank out more chips for cars. Smartphone companies do not want their semiconductors diverted to automakers. Chip manufacturers say the auto industry shot itself in the foot by canceling semiconductor orders after the covid crisis hit. They are also impatient for Congress to approve $52 billion in federal subsidies to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing. That measure, supported by the White House, has cleared the Senate but not the House.
The Biden administration, meanwhile, says that while it can play a supporting role, it expects the private sector to take the lead in sorting out the crisis.
""It's on industry to come up with the solutions here and to identify some of the path forward,"" one of the administration officials said Wednesday, speaking on the condition of anonymity to preview Thursday's meeting.

CFIUS Prepares To Block Semiconductor Sale To Chinese Entity

As close observers of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS” or “Committee”) are aware, the Committee has the authority to recommend that the President of the United States block a transaction on national security grounds. Although it is extraordinarily rare for CFIUS to make such a recommendation, that is exactly what occurred this week to Magnachip Semiconductor Corporation (“Magnachip”), a South Korean chip manufacturer. The Committee’s aggressive action signals that companies operating overseas with even a limited nexus to the United States need to undertake CFIUS due diligence before engaging in a transaction in sectors—like semiconductors—that implicate the U.S. government’s core national security concerns.
Deal Background
In March 2021, Chinese private equity firm Wise Road Capital agreed to acquire Magnachip in a deal valued at $1.4 billion. Magnachip is a semiconductor company founded and headquartered in South Korea, but publicly traded in the United States (NYSE: MX) and incorporated in Delaware. The company designs and manufactures analog and mixed signal semiconductors, with revenues of over $500 million in 2020. While publicly traded in the United States, Magnachip has very little, if any, operations within the United States. According to the company’s 8-K submitted to the SEC in May 2021, all of its research and development activities take place outside the United States, primarily in South Korea, and its sales activities take place in South Korea, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, and Germany. Magnachip does not have any employees, tangible assets, or IT systems in the United States.
CFIUS Asserts Jurisdiction
After the parties announced the transaction in March 2021 without submitting a filing to CFIUS, the Committee reached out to the parties in June 2021 requesting that they submit a filing, which they did. In a rare move, CFIUS then issued an interim order preventing closing of the transaction until it completed its review of the case. 
CFIUS Blocks Transaction
On August 27, 2021, Magnachip disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) that the parties recently received a letter from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the agency that chairs CFIUS. Pursuant to the letter, the parties were made aware that “CFIUS has identified risks to the national security of the United States arising as a result of the [transaction],” and no “mitigation measures, including those proposed jointly by [the parties]” were considered by CFIUS to “adequately mitigate the identified risks.” Importantly, the letter notes that “absent new information arising during the investigation period that alters CFIUS’s assessment of the national security risks, CFIUS anticipates that it will refer the matter to the President for a decision.”
In layman’s terms, CFIUS thinks this transaction, no matter how many mitigating controls are put in place, poses a threat to U.S. national security, and it is therefore recommending that President Biden block it. By law, only the president has the authority to prohibit a transaction. In practice, it is rare for CFIUS to send a transaction to the president for action, because parties in most cases agree to abandon or unwind a transaction that CFIUS would otherwise send to the president to avoid a public Presidential Order blocking the transaction. For illustration, CFIUS data published on its website shows that from 2016 through 2020, five cases were sent to the president for decision, while in the same period, 62 cases were withdrawn and transactions abandoned in light of CFIUS-related national security concerns.
Takeaways
Expanding jurisdiction. CFIUS applies to foreign acquisitions of and investments in a U.S. business, defined as an entity engaged in interstate commerce in the United States. CFIUS is willing to assert itself in sensitive transactions even where there is a very limited nexus to an actual business in the United States. Ostensibly, it was Magnachip’s public listing on the NYSE, its Delaware incorporation, and a Delaware LLC subsidiary that afforded CFIUS the jurisdictional hook, but all of the elements of the business— management, sales, production, research and development—are located outside the United States.
Past is not prologue. Despite the rarity of blocking actions and limited jurisdictional nexus, CFIUS did not hesitate to inject itself in a transaction it perceived to raise national security issues. The action signals historical CFIUS patterns and practices should not be given significant weight. If the Committee perceives an avenue to protect perceived national security concerns, it will take it. 
Scrutiny on the chip industry. CFIUS’s decision to recommend blocking the transaction further evidences the heightened scrutiny the U.S. government applies to the chip sector, particularly to sales to Chinese entities.
You can’t hide. As detailed above, Magnachip and Wise Road Capital did not make a voluntary filing with CFIUS. Instead, the Committee’s non-notified team reached out to them after the deal was publicly announced to request a filing. This is a prime example of CFIUS’s expanded investigative capabilities. The Committee has been building up its non‑notified team to search for transactions that may pose national security risks but were not voluntarily notified to CFIUS. We discussed this point in our recent article on the 2020 CFIUS Annual report, which indicated that CFIUS evaluated 117 transactions through its non-notified process in 2020 and requested a filing for 17 of those transactions.

Understanding the global chip shortage, a big crisis involving tiny components
Semiconductors help power everything from your phone to your car. Here's what to know about the major supply chain problem.
BY SHIRA FEDER | UPDATED AUG 9, 2021 10:21 AM
TECHNOLOGY
A modern Intel chip. The company's CEO has said he thinks the industry needs one or two years before the shortage resolves. Intel
SHARE
There are chips in nearly everything electric you own, from your phone to your computer to your car. There are even chips in items you wouldn’t expect, such as your washing machine, electric toothbrush, and refrigerator. But these tiny parts that power so much of our lives are now in critically short supply. 
Top Articles

“Right now we have a global supply chain in crisis,” says Patrick Penfield, a professor of supply chain practice at Syracuse University. “We’ve just never ever seen anything of this magnitude impact us before.”
Nissan said it will be making 500,000 less vehicles due to the chip shortage. General Motors has had to interrupt some of its pickup truck production due to lack of semiconductor chips and has even been parking thousands of vehicles that are completed but still don’t have the needed chips. Apple CEO Tim Cook warned the public in July that chip shortages would affect sales of its phones and tablets.
Intel chief Pat Gelsinger predicts it will be a year or two before supply can meet demand, and experts say holiday shopping may not offer the variety and options we’re used to.
Here’s how the chip shortage happened—and when it might be over.
What are these chips?
The chips, often called semiconductors, sometimes called microchips, function as the brains of our electronics. They’re tiny technological marvels, hosting billions of transistors within them, though the size of the chip can vary. (Those transistors are like tiny little gates, allowing electrons to pass through them or not.) Their construction involves multiple steps, days, and experts on hand. For example, IBM’s newest chip packs 50 billion transistors into a two nanometer, fingernail-sized space.
“I imagine there are more than 100 billion chips in daily use around the world,” says Matteo Rinaldi, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Northeastern University. “So think about how many transistors and semiconductors we use in our lives everyday.” 
These chips are the lifeblood of modern society, but even before the pandemic, demand for them exceeded supply. This year, economist Rory Green called semiconductors “the new oil,” pointing out that Taiwan and Korea control the lion’s share of chip production today. But while these chips were an American invention, the number of US manufacturers currently creating them has declined severely. In 1990, 37 percent of chips were made in America, says James Lewis, senior vice president and director of CSIS’s Strategic Technologies Program. By 2020, that number was only 12 percent.
[Related: Here’s the simple law behind your shrinking gadgets]
For decades, the tech industry has been driven by a prediction made by Intel cofounder Gordon Moore in 1965; it held that “the number of transistors incorporated in a chip will approximately double every 24 months.” And building a factory that can create these chips, which have been consistently shrinking over the years, can cost $10 billion, a price that is prohibitive to most companies. “These are multibillion dollar facilities at the cutting edge of science,” says Lewis.
What is the chip shortage? 
As the world shut down because of the COVID-19 pandemic, many factories closed with it, making the supplies needed for chip manufacturing unavailable for months. Increased demand for consumer electronics caused shifts that rippled up the supply chain. Orders began to pile up as manufacturers struggled to create enough chips to meet the new levels of demand. A backlog began to grow and grow and grow.
Car companies, like Ford, have to predict the amount of chips they will need to produce their cars and order them in advance from one of the chip manufacturers. As of now, it can take at least half of a year for a chip order to come in, says Penfield. The current demand for chips is so great that manufacturers can’t make enough chips to meet it at this time, meaning consumers will soon be seeing higher prices for less goods.

But the issue wasn’t just with manufacturing. As COVID made its way through Asia, ports shut down, sometimes for months. Some 90 percent of the world’s electronics go through China’s Yantian port, and it was recently closed, leaving hundreds of container ships waiting to dock. 
Once the ports reopened, bottlenecks emerged because of the buildup of items waiting to be shipped. Many parts of the transportation supply chain don’t have the capacity to handle this buildup, or the labor shortages that have been occurring, plunging the supply chain into further crisis. 
What caused the chip shortage?
“Bad decisions, bad luck, and then increased demand. Put those three together and you got a shortage,” says Lewis. The pandemic caused an explosive surge in demand for devices. People were at home, using more tablets, phones and other streaming devices than ever before, and the need skyrocketed beyond what manufacturers could provide.
Bad decisions by the auto industry also added to the shortage. When COVID started, many companies canceled their orders for chips because they assumed the economy was about to take a lengthy hit, says Lewis. Car companies in particular cancelled orders, so chip companies switched to making chips for consumer products, attempting to meet the explosive demand caused by the pandemic. Having retooled their plants to make chips for consumer goods instead of cars, a shortage of car chips ensued.

There aren’t many chip manufacturing plants in the world, and the few that were running during the pandemic were subject to a series of unlucky weather events that delayed the manufacturing process further. Japan’s Renesas plant, which creates almost one-third of the chips used in cars around the world, was severely damaged by a fire, while winter storms in Texas forced some of America’s only chip plants to halt production. Producing these chips also requires a lot of water, and severe drought in Taiwan has also affected production.
Does China play a role?
While geopolitical concerns are not the main cause of this chip shortage, one ongoing concern is Taiwan’s tense relationship with China. Taiwan is the world’s leading chip producer, and the theoretical possibility of war between China and Taiwan puts American access to the chip industry in potential jeopardy, and could be catastrophic for many industries that would be unable to get the chips they rely on. “China is deeply tempted to just seize Taiwan,” says Lewis. “The Chinese are desperate to have their own chip industry. It’s become a focal point for the competition between the US and China.”
President Joe Biden is making a push to invest in American chip manufacturing, asking for a $50 billion investment in the chip industry. The Senate has passed a bill offering tax credits and other incentives for chip manufacturers.

American chip manufacturer Intel has announced plans to scale up their chip production, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co and Samsung eye locations for the American factories they plan to build. But while these plans are promising, it will take years before these factories can ramp up their production levels.
What are the effects of the shortage? 
“Prices are definitely going to be higher for a lot of devices that require a semiconductor,” says David Yoffie, a Harvard Business School professor who spent almost three decades serving on the board of Intel. “Some products are literally not going to ship, or they’re going to be delayed.” 
The auto industry is getting hit hard, with estimates saying US manufacturers will make at least 1.5 to 5 million less cars this year. Ford and General Motors have already limited production. Tesla revised its own software to support alternative chips to maintain its production levels.
And while consumer electronics companies like Apple and Samsung began stockpiling chips early on, saving them from the immense delays the auto industry is facing, Apple recently announced that the chip shortage is expected to delay iPhone production and is already impacting sales of iPads and Macs. Xboxes and Playstations are also in short supply. 
“It’s gonna be a tough holiday season,” says Penfield. “One thing I would caution consumers on is you probably won’t see the variety that you’re accustomed to. If you can buy before the holiday season really gets going, I think you’re going to be in good shape.”
When will the issue be resolved?
Opinions on when the shortage will end vary. The CEO of chipmaker STMicro estimated that the shortage will end by early 2023. The CEO of automaker Stellantis said that the shortage “is going to drag into ’22, easy.” Intel CEO Patrick Gelsinger said the shortage could last two more years. 
“We’ve probably got about nine, 10 months of this to live through,” says Lewis. “If you can afford to wait, prices will go down.”
Yoffie’s expectation is that some of the demand will begin to slow down over the next 6 to 12 months. But he estimates that it will likely be two years before supply catches up with demand and equilibrium is reached. 
“When you get down to three nanometers and two nanometers, which are the levels that we’re talking about for next-generation technology, it’s rocket science, and rocket science is something that doesn’t get solved in a nanosecond,” says Yoffie. “You have to be patient.”

Samsung Group, South Korea’s tech giant, announced on Tuesday that it will invest $205 billion (240 trillion won) in their semiconductor, biopharmaceuticals and telecommunications units over the next three years to enhance its global presence and lead in new industries such as next-generation telecommunication and robotics.
The investment will be led by Samsung affiliates including Samsung Electronics and Samsung Biologics. It also unveiled a mergers and acquisitions plan to fortify its technology and market leadership.
Setting aside $154.3 billion (180 trillion won) for home ground, Samsung expects to create 40,000 new jobs by 2023 through the investment.
This announcement comes days after Samsung Electronics vice chairman Jay Y. Lee was released on parole on 13 August right before South Korea’s Liberation Day. People speculated Samsung would be able to move forward with major investments once he was freed from prison, according to local media reports.
Samsung’s latest investment will be used for semiconductors, biopharmaceuticals and the next-generation telco units, according to the company’s statement.
Samsung Electronics plans to develop advanced process technology and expand the business with artificial intelligence (AI) and data centers for its system semiconductors while it will focus on up-to-date technology such as EUV-based sub14-nanometer DRAM and over 200-layer V-NAND products for the memory business. Samsung had announced in May the company will invest $151 billion in its logic chip and foundry sector, to be the top logic chip maker, by 2030.
Samsung Biologics and Samsung Bioepis plan to establish two new plants, in addition to a fourth factory that is under construction, for expanding the contract development manufacturing organization (CDMO) business, the statement said.
South Korea’s largest conglomerate also will support its ongoing R&D in new technologies and emerging application in areas such as AI and robotics along with the next generation OLED, quantum-dot display and high-energy density batteries development.

Intel just signed a major chip-making deal with the Pentagon, and it could help the US solve its semiconductor problem
The company will be part of an effort to build a US-based semiconductor production ecosystem.
By Daphne Leprince-Ringuet | August 24, 2021 | Topic: Hardware
Intel has landed a deal with the Pentagon to domestically design and manufacture the computer chips that are required by critical Department of Defense (DoD) systems, as part of growing efforts to boost the US's capabilities when it comes to producing semiconductors. 
This comes in the context of a global shortage of semiconductors, which sees a large number of industries, ranging from consumer electronics to automotive, struggling to secure key components needed to build their products. 
The agreement is part of the first phase of a program launched by the National Security Technology Accelerator (NSTXL), called RAMP-C (Rapid Assured Microelectronics Prototypes – Commercial), with the objective of creating a US-based ecosystem of commercial fabrication plants for semiconductors, also called foundries. 
RAMP-C will ensure that the Pentagon has access to critical semiconductor technology and is also designed to strengthen overall supply chain security, keeping the US on top of the latest advances in chip design, manufacturing and packaging.

Arm processors: Everything you need to know now
As the only US company that both designs and produces semiconductors, Intel seems a logical choice to work on RAMP-C. Earlier this year, the company launched a dedicated foundry business called Intel Foundry Services, which will lead the work carried out together with the DoD. 
""Intel is the sole American company both designing and manufacturing logic semiconductors at the leading edge of technology,"" said Pat Gelsinger, Intel's CEO. ""When we launched Intel Foundry Services earlier this year, we were excited to have the opportunity to make our capabilities available to a wider range of partners, including in the US government, and it is great to see that potential being fulfilled through programs like RAMP-C."" 
The Santa Clara firm will partner with industry leaders like IBM, Cadence and Synopsys to support the Pentagon's needs for custom integrated circuits and commercial products, with the end goal of establishing a robust semiconductor ecosystem in the US. 
Currently, the supply chain for computer chips is crippled by vulnerabilities, which pose a security risk for organizations that are central to national security like the DoD and is the reason behind the launch RAMP-C. 
Historically, companies have preferred to design their own semiconductors and outsource the manufacturing process to third-party foundries. Given the complexity of fabricating semiconductors, the market quickly consolidated, leaving just a handful of companies running the foundries in which most of the world's computer chip orders are placed.  
The most established of these are Samsung and TSMC. As a result, about three quarters of the world's total semiconductor manufacturing capacity comes from China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan – and virtually all of the world's advanced semiconductor manufacturing capacity (in nodes below ten nanometers) is located in South Korea and Taiwan. 
At the same time, manufacturing capacity in the US has significantly declined. According to a recent report carried out by the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), the US held 37% of the global chip manufacturing capacity in 1990 – a number that has gone down to 12% today, mostly due to the stagnation of government subsidies to help the industry prosper. 
This means that key organizations like the DoD in the US have limited access to domestic supplies of semiconductors, even for critical security systems – and there remains a question mark over the country's capacity to meet its own needs for computer chips in the long term. 
The issue has come to the fore in recent months, as the Covid-19 pandemic increased the demand for products like smartphones, laptops and tablets, which has in turn placed a strain on the foundries supplying computer chips. Fabrication plants have reached the limits of their capabilities, creating a global shortage of semiconductors that is expected to last well into 2022 and is now trickling down to any industry that relies on the components. 
""One of the most profound lessons of the past year is the strategic importance of semiconductors, and the value to the US of having a strong domestic semiconductor industry,"" said Gelsinger. 
Tech giants including Amazon, Cisco, Google, Apple, Microsoft and HPE reacted by creating the Semiconductors in America Coalition (SIAC), which urged the US government to invest $50 billion to fund the expansion of the country's manufacturing capabilities. 
The call seems to have been heard. Earlier this year, the US Senate passed a landmark bill that would unlock $52 billion to boost the national production of semiconductors. 
Developing a domestic ecosystem for computer chip fabrication, however, requires more than money. The US government, in addition to RAMP-C, has therefore launched two more complementary programs, RAMP and SHIP, which are designed to ramp up national capabilities at different stages of the design and manufacturing of semiconductors.  
While RAMP-C addresses the need for foundry capabilities, RAMP is concerned with the process of physical design, and SHIP looks at the packaging and testing of integrated circuits. 
Intel, for its part, has separately announced an investment of $20 billion to expand US-based capacity thanks to two new foundries in Arizona.  
Randhir Thakur, Intel Foundry Services president, said: ""Along with our customers and ecosystem partners, including IBM, Cadence, Synopsys and others, we will help bolster the domestic semiconductor supply chain and ensure the United States maintains leadership in both R&D and advanced manufacturing.""

Inside the Taiwan Firm That Makes the World’s Tech Run
A worker enters a “clean room” at chipmaker TSMC’s headquarters in Hsinchu, Taiwan, on Sept. 10 Billy H.C. Kwok for TIME
BY CHARLIE CAMPBELL
OCTOBER 1, 2021 6:30 AM EDT
O
n the northwest coast of Taiwan, nestled between mudflats teeming with fiddler crabs and sweet-scented persimmon orchards, sits the world’s most important company that you’ve probably never heard of. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., or TSMC, is the world’s largest contract manufacturer of the semiconductor chips—otherwise known as integrated circuits, or just chips—that power our phones, laptops, cars, watches, refrigerators and more. Its clients include Apple, Intel, Qualcomm, AMD and Nvidia.
Inside its boxy off-white headquarters in sleepy Hsinchu County, technicians in brightly hued protective suits—white and blue for employees, green for contractors and pink for pregnant women—push polished metal carts under a sallow protective light. Above their heads, “claw machines”—nicknamed after the classic arcade game—haul 9-kg plastic containers containing 25 individual slices, or “wafers,” of silicon on rails among hundreds of manufacturing stations, where they are extracted one by one for processing, much like a jukebox selecting a record. Only after six to eight weeks of painstaking etching and testing can each wafer be carved up into individual chips to be dispatched around the planet.
“We always say that it’s like building a high-rise,” one TSMC section manager tells TIME, pointing to how his technicians diligently follow instructions dictated to them via tablet. “You can only build one story at a time.”
The $550 billion firm today controls more than half the global market for made-to-order chips and has an even tighter stranglehold on the most advanced processors, with more than 90% of market share by some estimates.

TSMC workers in the “clean room” where fabrication of chips takes place in the company’s Hsinchu headquarters Billy H.C. Kwok for TIME
“TSMC is just absolutely critical,” says Peter Hanbury, a semiconductor specialist at the Bain & Co. consulting firm. “They basically control the most complicated part of the semiconductor ecosystem, and they’re a near monopoly at the bleeding edge.”
The importance of semiconductor chips has grown exponentially over the past half century. In 1969, the Apollo lunar module sent tens of thousands of transistors with a combined weight of 70 lb. to the moon; today, an Apple MacBook crams 16 billion transistors within its total weight of just 3 lb. The prevalence of chips will keep rising alongside the spread of mobile devices, the Internet of things (IOT), 5G and 6G networks and a growth in demand for computing power. Global chip sales were $440 billion in 2020 and are projected to grow over 5% annually. President Joe Biden calls them “critical products” whose “supply-chain disruptions can put Americans’ lives and livelihoods at risk,” while the governments of Japan and South Korea compare the importance of semiconductors to “rice.”
TSMC’s success in cornering this vital market has become a geostrategic migraine. The Pentagon is pressing the Biden Administration to invest more in advanced chipmaking, so its missiles and fighter jets are not dependent on a self-ruling island that China’s strongman President Xi Jinping believes is a breakaway province and has repeatedly threatened to invade. More immediately, a global chip shortage has impacted a staggering 169 industries, according to Goldman Sachs analysis, from steel and ready-mix concrete to air-conditioning units and breweries. Most drastically, automakers across America, Japan and Europe were forced to slow and even halt production, meaning 3.9 million fewer cars will roll into world showrooms this year than last.
Car companies “immediately pointed the finger at TSMC” for the shortage, TSMC chairman Mark Liu tells TIME in an exclusive interview. “But I told them, ‘You are my customer’s customer’s customer. How could I [prioritize others] and not give you chips?’”
The scarcity of chips has thrust TSMC from a largely anonymous services company to the center of a global tussle over the future of technology; the firm will play an outsize role in determining what the world looks like at the end of this decade. Some foresee an emerging dystopia, driven by a worsening climate crisis and rising geopolitical tensions between China and the U.S. Liu’s more optimistic scenario is that widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) by 2030 will help mitigate the ravages of climate change through granular weather prediction, make more accurate cancer diagnoses possible earlier, and even fight fake news through automated fact-checking of social media. “With COVID-19, everybody feels the future has been sped up,” says Liu. From his perspective, what it will look like “is much clearer than, say, two years ago.”
The semiconductor-chip shortage first got boardrooms sweating around February, when average order-to-delivery times for chips stretched to an unprecedented 15 weeks because of a confluence of factors: a pandemic-induced economic slump prompted carmakers to prematurely slash chip orders, which soon rebounded as chips were hoarded by firms that feared being embroiled in the U.S.-China trade and technology war. Amid what was described as a global chip shortage, more chips were being sent to factories than were leaving them in products, meaning “there are people definitely accumulating chips who-knows-where in the supply chain,” says Liu.

To fix things, Liu ordered his team to triangulate different data points to decipher which customers were truly in need and which were stockpiling. “We are learning too, because we didn’t have to do this before,” says Liu. It forced him into tough decisions to delay orders for valued clients whose immediate need was judged to be less acute. “Sometimes [customers] may not be satisfied, but we just have to do what’s best for the industry.”
The crisis sharpened focus on access to technology that the U.S. invented and still designs better than anyone else but doesn’t manufacture at scale anymore. Biden’s $2 trillion plan to fix American infrastructure included $50 billion to boost semiconductor competitiveness. That was on top of $52 billion committed under the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act, which was passed by the Senate in June and is aimed squarely at competing with China in all areas of technology. Yet TSMC alone is investing $100 billion in new capacity over the next three years. It’s a staggering sum, though for Liu, “the more I look at it, it’s not going to be enough.”
The semiconductor industry has contracted even as the chips themselves have grown more prevalent and pivotal. Other than TSMC, the only firm capable of commercially producing today’s most advanced 5-nanometer (nm) chips is South Korea’s Samsung Electronics. However, TSMC is building a new fabrication plant—or “fab”—across 22 football fields of land in southern Taiwan to produce groundbreaking 3-nm chips, expected to be up to 15% faster and use far less power. This latest generation of chip manufacture, or “node,” will leave U.S. firms like Intel and GlobalFoundries at least two generations behind. “That’s disgraceful for Intel,” says Daniel Nenni, co-author of Fabless: The Transformation of the Semiconductor Industry. “It’s just very disappointing that they lost leadership.”

At the outset of the modern computing industry, pioneers like Intel designed and built chips in-house. But American firms began to struggle against Japanese competitors in the 1980s and, to remain competitive, outsourced the fabricating sides of their businesses, instead concentrating on the more profitable design aspect. Fabs were expensive, with low margins, so offsetting that capital investment and risk made a lot of sense.
The “fabless” trend was foreseen by a canny Chinese-born engineer named Morris Chang, who founded TSMC in 1987 after studying at Harvard, Stanford and MIT and working for 25 years at Texas Instruments. Among his many breakthroughs, Chang pioneered the tactic of initially pricing chips at a loss, in the expectation that gaining an early market share would increase scale to the point when reduced costs would generate a profit. As the technology advanced, the cost of new fabs soared, pushing more chipmakers to outsource and TSMC’s market share to increase. “It was doing work that nobody else wanted to do,” says Willy Shih, a professor at Harvard Business School.
Workers and visitors must don dust-proof clothing before entering the clean room Billy H.C. Kwok for TIME
In June 2018, at the age of 86, Chang finally handed over the reins of TSMC to Liu and CEO C.C. Wei. What might have been a difficult transition instead proved a springboard for a more aggressive business philosophy that enabled TSMC to pull clear of rivals. Apart from the billions invested in locking down technological primacy, it is embarking on “a geographic diversification that would not have happened under Morris Chang,” says Shih. While Wei was the more technically focused of the new leadership team, he was perfectly complemented by the polished and business-oriented Liu, whose idea of fun is kicking back with a global-affairs periodical and a classical-music stream on YouTube.
In many ways, Liu’s career path traces that of his mentor, Chang. A native of Taipei, Liu earned his Ph.D. at the University of California, Berkeley, before taking a job at Intel, where he helped launch the transformative i386 processor that fueled the personal-computer revolution of the late 1980s. After leaving Intel, he spent six years conducting research at AT&T Bell Laboratories in New Jersey before joining TSMC in 1993. One of his first roles was to get his “hands wet” in fab construction, he says, as the founder took him under his wing. “Morris gave me a huge trail of experience, from operations to planning, sales, marketing and R&D,” says Liu. “That’s why I ask our people to get out of their comfort zone to learn things and not just feel satisfied getting a good performance review from your boss.”
TSMC’s more recent run of success has been linked to one client in particular: Apple. The Cupertino behemoth outsourced the manufacturing of its chips to Samsung for the first six generations of iPhones. But after Samsung launched its own competing Galaxy smartphones, Apple in 2011 brought a lawsuit over IP theft, which was ultimately settled with an award of $539 million to the American firm. That dispute was a boon to TSMC as Apple sought to extricate its supply chains from Samsung and avoid any partnerships that could burnish a potential rival. It was reassuring that TSMC was a dedicated foundry business that wouldn’t stray from its lane. Apple remains TSMC’s biggest client today. “It is a trust business,” says Liu. “We do not compete with our customers.”
Apple was also pivotal to TSMC’s emergence as undisputed technology leader. Computing has been long governed by Moore’s Law, named after Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, which is better described as an “observation” that processing power doubles every two or so years. The tendency of the industry was to prioritize a new semiconductor node to fit that time frame.
However, Apple insisted that it wanted a new node for each iteration of iPhone. Because Apple prides itself on never missing a launch of its crown jewel, TSMC was under enormous pressure to come up with constant advances. So instead of combining lots of new technologies to double power every two years, it pioneered small advances annually. “People made fun of TSMC, saying, ‘Oh, that’s not a real node,’” says Nenni. “But taking these baby steps helped them learn these new technologies. And they laughed all the way to the bank.”
Still, leadership brings different challenges. Chips may be ubiquitous today, but uses for the most advanced variety remain limited. (Toasters and traffic lights can use far less advanced nodes.) As TSMC’s pool of customers has shrunk, the risk of one of them being caught up in political turbulence has swelled; TSMC last year stopped supplying Chinese telecom giant Huawei, for example, after U.S. intelligence agencies accused it—without presenting hard evidence—of being a proxy for the Chinese state. Finding the required resources to keep pushing boundaries is also becoming tougher on an island of just 23 million, where a recent severe drought put the water-intensive semiconductor industry in jeopardy. “The future is more and more challenging,” says Dan Wang, an industry and technology analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics. “When you’re at the top, the only direction is down.”

TSMC’s dominance is such that its chief rivals are not companies but governments. The auto-industry shortage was a wake-up call for policymakers already reeling from the pandemic and trade war. The European Commission has unveiled a public-private semiconductor alliance aimed at increasing its share of global production to 20% by 2030. South Korea’s government is offering incentives to drive a $450 billion investment by chipmakers through 2030.

China, meanwhile, has been throwing billions at the semiconductor problem, with limited success and some eye-catching failures. Although it will likely soon become the biggest producer of chips by volume, they are not of the latest design. Its top firm is Shanghai-based SMIC, but despite $300 million in government grants in 2019, the best chip it can produce is about five years behind TSMC’s, with little hope of catching up. Meanwhile, at least six multibillion-dollar Chinese chip firms have gone bust over the past two years, including Wuhan Hongxin Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which turned out to be a $20 billion scam perpetrated by tricksters with no industry experience.
Beijing’s efforts to catch up have also been hampered by Washington’s repeatedly blocking its attempts to buy foreign chip firms outright, as well as the specialized equipment needed for cutting-edge fabs. This presents a quandary for Beijing, which aspires to the enhanced geopolitical clout that global technological leadership brings. Xi has regularly highlighted the critical importance of “indigenous R&D,” creating “secure and controllable supply chains” and achieving breakthroughs on “choke-point technologies.”
The situation also presents a quandary to Taiwan and the U.S. While American firms account for 65% of all TSMC sales, China is the biggest end destination by virtue of its role as the world’s factory, importing around $350 billion worth of chips in 2020 alone. Boston Consulting Group estimates that “decoupling” the U.S. and Chinese tech sectors would trim U.S. chip-company revenues by $80 billion, while competition with Beijing would cost those same firms $10 billion to $15 billion.
Liu echoes many business executives when he says that the current enmity between the U.S. and China benefits no one. Many Chinese firms are stockpiling chips lest they find themselves targeted as Huawei has been. “The U.S. and China need to understand that they may not be friends, but they are not enemies either,” says Liu. “We need common rules to … give people some expectation about how to do business.”
If TSMC is caught in the middle of a tug-of-war between Washington and Beijing, then so too is the island on which it sits—with far more dangerous potential consequences. On Sept. 16, senior U.S. and Australian officials vowed to “strengthen ties” with Taiwan just a day after both nations, with the U.K., unveiled a new security alliance, dubbed AUKUS, to contain China. Beijing is already sending air and naval sorties close to Taiwan territory with alarming frequency.
Strategists say Taiwan is protected by an effective “silicon shield,” given what the disruption to chip supply chains in the event of an invasion would mean for China’s economy. However, as tensions and the importance of chips rise in tandem, some analysts are reassessing this viewpoint. Oriana Skylar Mastro, a specialist on China’s military at Stanford University’s Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, says the prospect of gaining effective control of the world’s chip supply may make Taiwan more, not less, vulnerable, because a prize that big means Beijing could effectively dictate peace terms: “I think it gives China an upper hand.”
Liu disagrees, insisting the threat of invasion by Beijing is “overblown.” “Taiwan definitely would not create actions to trigger a war,” he says, acknowledging that the cross-strait relationship is no longer dictated solely by the island. “It is really the U.S.-China relationship.”
Despite America’s dominance of chip design, its lack of manufacturing capability remains worrisome for policymakers, who are trying to bring more fabs onshore. While remaining a TSMC customer, Intel is revamping its foundry business, building two new fabs in Arizona at a cost of $20 billion. Last year, TSMC committed to building a $12 billion fab, also in the Grand Canyon State. It is also exploring more plants in mainland China, Japan and Europe.
Liu is candid about the reasons for that U.S. investment and its limitations. It was prompted by “political nudges on our customers,” he says, insisting that “semiconductor localization will not increase supply-chain resilience.” He says it may even “degrade resilience.”

Making chips is so unbelievably complex and specialized that diversifying the location of fabs will make it more difficult to maintain quality. The transistor in a 3-nm node is just 1/20,000th the width of a human hair. Were you to enlarge a foot-long wafer of semiconductor to the size of the continental U.S., the required patterning for these chips would still be only the width of a thumbnail. The key component may only be silicon—or purified sand—but the magic happens in how it is processed and manipulated. “It’s like baking bread,” says the TSMC section manager. “The ingredients are pretty much the same, but how long should you bake it, what temperature should it be, that’s what matters.”
A FOUP (Front Opening Unified Pod) waiting to be picked up from the stocker Billy H.C. Kwok for TIME
For this reason, TSMC’s foundry is meticulously controlled. All visitors must don head covers, dust-free jackets, pants and shoes before passing through an “air shower” to remove errant particles. The extreme ultraviolet lithography machines that TSMC uses each cost around $175 million. Larger fabs will have 20 of them. Creating a chip takes around 1,500 steps, each with 100 to 500 variables. Even if each step’s success rate is 99.9%, that means less than a quarter of the final output is usable. “Is there something slightly different in the water or the air or the chemicals in Arizona?” asks Hanbury. “The R&D team is not going to be a bullet train away to solve these problems.”
While TSMC founder Chang praised “cheap land and electricity” in the U.S. in a recent speech, he also grumbled that “we had to try hard to scout out competent technicians and workers.” Liu notes that costs in the U.S. have turned out to be “much higher” than TSMC expected.
It all points to a localization craze driven by politics rather than by science or business. After all, opening a fab in the U.S. affects only one small part of the manufacturing process. Today, semiconductors are typically designed in the U.S., fabricated in Taiwan or South Korea, tested and assembled in Southeast Asia, and then installed into products in China. It is already incredibly specialized: as much as TSMC dominates foundry services, only the Dutch firm ASML produces those advanced lithography machines that all its fabs rely on.
If a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, opening fabs in the U.S. won’t strengthen much. U.S. competitiveness may be boosted only incrementally. The new TSMC plant in Arizona, for one, will produce 5-nm chips, which, though cutting edge today, will be a couple of nodes behind the fastest when mass production begins in 2024. Meanwhile, TSMC’s headquarters will be moving ahead with next-generation 3-D integrated circuits, which, Liu says, “will unleash the innovation of semiconductor architectures.”
These technologies are so advanced that it’s impossible to catch up without pumping in vast sums of money. Even then, nothing is guaranteed. After all, the $100 billion investment that TSMC unveiled does not stand alone. It is combined with and augmented by the deep R&D pockets of Apple, Nvidia and all TSMC’s other close partners to create a “budget that is 100 times what you will see on their financials,” says Nenni. “It’s just impossible for any company or country to catch up to this huge ecosystem that’s moving forward like a freight train.”
What would make more sense, says Liu, is for the U.S. to ensure it stands at the frontier of the next great advance. Its lifesaving prowess in mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, for example, exists only because of huge investments in genomics and biotechnology over the past 40 years. Instead of futilely chasing and localizing aspects of the semiconductor supply chain, Liu suggests plowing that same money into developing the next great leap.
“The U.S. should focus on their strengths: system design, AI, quantum computing, those forward-looking things,” says Liu. TSMC may already have won 2030, but the decade after is still up for grabs. —With reporting by Gladys Tsai/Hsinchu and Alejandro de la Garza/New York

Google is planning to build its own semiconductor chips to power its Chromebook laptops and computers from around 2023, Nikkei Asia reported Wednesday.
Unnamed sources close to the matter told Nikkei that the company hopes to use its own chips to run devices that use the Chrome operating system. They will be based on chip blueprints of Arm, a UK chip design company, the sources said. 
Some Chromebooks use Intel's semiconductor chips, according to Intel's website. 
Semiconductor chips are small units, usually made of silicon, which power electronic devices like  smartphones and computers. Multiple industries have faced severe shortages of chips in recent months.
In-house chip development could enable tech companies to build features specific to their products and ease their reliance on suppliers.

In August, the tech giant announced that it would use its own chips, called Tensor, to power its Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro smartphones. Rick Osterloh, a Google hardware executive, previously told Insider that the chip would enable the Pixel phones to better process AI software. 
Last year, Axios first reported that Google was developing chips for its Pixel phones, and that subsequent versions could be used to run its Chromebook products, but did not specify when. But Nikkei's report on Wednesday said the new Google chips could arrive within the next two years. 
Google was inspired by Apple's development of its own iPhone chips, and its plan to replace Intel's chips with its own custom versions for its Mac computers, two unnamed sources told Nikkei Asia. 
Google did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

Devices used in renewable energy products accused of infringing
Semiconductor technology created by Purdue professor, student

(Reuters) - Purdue University has sued STMicroelectronics, one of Europe's largest chip makers, in West Texas federal court alleging that its transistors infringe the school's semiconductor patents.
The Wednesday complaint, filed in U.S. District Judge Alan Albright's patent-heavy Waco court, says that ST's metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs), used in solar HVAC systems, car charging stations, and other renewable-energy products, infringe two of Purdue's patents.
Purdue didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, and its attorney Mark Siegmund of Shore Chan declined to comment. ST also declined to comment.
MOSFETs are generally used in electronics to control and amplify the flow of electricity. Purdue's patents relate to semiconductors for high-voltage power applications and innovations in MOSFET technology created by former Purdue professor James Cooper and his then-student Asmita Saha.
Geneva, Switzerland-based ST makes MOSFETs that allegedly infringe these patents. Purdue says ST has been aware of the alleged infringement since April, when the university outlined it in a letter to the company.
The complaint also says ST induces others to infringe through their distribution and sale of infringing products and by instructing end users how to use them in an infringing way.
The case is Trustees of Purdue Univ. v. STMicroelectronics NV, U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, No. 6:21-cv-00727.
For Purdue: Mark Siegmund of Shore Chan
For ST: not available

TWO NEW SEMICONDUCTOR-BASED NANOMATERIALS SYNTHESIZED FOR THE FIRST TIME
By Gerald Ondrey | October 1, 2021
The latest generations of computer chips are only a few nanometers in size and are becoming ever more energy-saving and powerful as a result of progressive miniaturization. Since the etching processes traditionally used in chip production are increasingly reaching their limits, the development of new, nanostructured semiconductor materials is essential. Such nanoscale semiconductors also play a central role in converting electricity into light and vice versa.
With these goals in sight, a team at Goethe University Frankfurt (Frankfurt am Main, Germany; www.goethe-university-frankfurt.de), led by professor Matthias Wagner, has succeeded in synthesizing molecular nano-scale spheres made of 20 silicon atoms, dubbed silafulleranes, with the formula (Cl@Si20H20) 1–. The 20 silicon atoms (blue) of silafullerane form a dodecahedron, a body composed of regular pentagons (diagram, left), and encapsulates a chloride ion (green). The hydrogen atoms (grey) that protrude outward at each silicon corner of the body can be replaced with functional groups to give the compound different properties.
The second new class of materials are crystalline building blocks made of 10 silicon (blue) and germanium (magenta) atoms that have a diamond-like structure (diagram, right). The silicon-germanium alloy has the potential to form “faultless” nanodiamond-like crystals, with possible applications in pharmaceutical and catalyst research.
Insights into the electronic structures of the new compounds were provided by computer-based theoretical analyses from professor Stefan Grimme’s research group at the University of Bonn (Germany; www.chemie.uni-bonn.de). The two new classes of materials have potential applications in the miniaturization of computer chips, in high-resolution screens for smartphones, and in solar cells and light-emitting diodes with the highest levels of efficiency.

OPINION
The Milwaukee region once was a leader in global innovation. It could be again with a new focus on semiconductors.
Thomas Fehring and Peter Kendall
View Comments
In her recent column, Kathleen Gallagher pitches the idea of a semiconductor fabrication facility, or “fab,” in the Wisconsin Valley technology park. It makes sense. The Racine site is shovel ready and largely vacant due to Foxconn’s stalled plans. Gallagher lays out national security, economic development and national and local public policy justifications for such a project.
But having a vibrant presence in semiconductors makes sense for another reason: It would be a giant step toward realigning Milwaukee with its history as a global leader in industrial innovation.
In the book, ""The Magnificent Machines of Milwaukee,"" Thomas Fehring chronicles a remarkable century of breakthroughs, ranging from the world’s first commercial typewriter in the 1860s to the casings for the Space Shuttle’s Solid Rocket Boosters in 1981. As an “industrial archeologist” and the immediate past chair of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers history and heritage committee, Fehring knows historically significant industrial achievements when he sees them. ""Magnificent Machines"" describes more than 150 engineering breakthroughs that placed Milwaukee at the center of a commercial revolution.
RELATED:Top Evers administration official Brennan in the dark about what Foxconn plans to do at its massive Mount Pleasant campus
But the conveyor belt of innovation jammed in the mid-1900s. The end of Milwaukee’s industrial pioneer phase is summed up in the story of one seminal invention that got away — the semiconductor.
By the mid-1950s, its creator, Jack Kilby, was a 10-year veteran at Milwaukee-based Centralab, where he applied leading-edge technology of transistors to hearing aid and TV set parts. On May 16, 1957, he attended a lecture at Marquette University given by Nobel laureate John Bardeen. Here’s the headline from the Milwaukee Journal’s review of that talk: “Two Inch Box Could Work TV, Bardeen Claims.” A year later, Kilby left for Texas Instruments, where within weeks he helped develop the world’s first microchip.
The semiconductor was simultaneously invented by a second person, Robert Noyce, who was employed at California startup Fairchild Semiconductor.  The burgeoning power of the trend toward industrial miniaturization is represented by what happened to San Jose. When Fairchild set up shop there in 1957, the area consisted of “mile after mile of fruit orchards.” Today, it is called Silicon Valley.
In 1958, Milwaukee interests could hardly be blamed for failing to recognize the potential — the semiconductor did not exist. The same could not be said a generation later. A Jan. 8, 1981, Milwaukee Journal article notes that Milwaukee had contributed to the country’s “age of largeness much as Silicon Valley, Calif., now pioneers in microelectronics, contributing to the age of smallness.”
Or how about the ceremony that took place 20 years later? In 2001, the picture shows the now Nobel laureate Jack Kilby receiving the equivalent of the keys to the city from a collection of Milwaukee dignitaries.
It was a nice gesture, but what if Milwaukee had gone further and actually joined the digital revolution? Even if it took yet another generation to bear fruit, any reasonable effort would now bask in the bright lights of another technology boom.
In 1981, and again, in 2001, Milwaukee got caught looking. Here in 2021, it is time for Milwaukee, to, at least, take a swing. As Gallagher points out, the ball is teed up for a consortium of venture capitalists and opportunistic politicians. In addition to a global semiconductor shortage, which Intel recently identified as a years-long phenomenon, funding sources are wide and deep.
Earlier this month, the U.S. Senate deepened the well by passing a bipartisan bill that would increase financing for “technology and manufacturing.” In an article on the measure, The New York Times cited the book, ""Jump-Starting America,"" which argues for more geographical diversity in research and development spending. The book identifies Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Dallas, Tampa, Rochester and Tucson as cities that have the schools, companies and infrastructure to become innovation hubs. At this point, Milwaukee is out of the conversation.
But Milwaukee has earned a place at the table. With the stakes high, spending is prompted primarily by concerns over “China’s commitment to innovation and investment in technology,” according to the Times report.
Milwaukee has what China lacks, a long history as an innovation capital, which, we believe, is a byproduct of a native affinity for the creation of leading-edge industrial products. The culture that produced Milwaukee’s golden era is still in place. The metro area still generally ranks well in income per capita, and Milwaukee trails none other than San Jose in per capita employment at companies that “make and design things.”
Milwaukee must focus more fully on the “age of smallness.” It has been more than 60 years since Bardeen made his “claim” at Marquette University, and still the road to security and prosperity is paved with semiconductors. Nothing could be more integral to a robust post-pandemic Milwaukee than a new semiconductor manufacturing facility that would be central to a new era of innovation and growth.
Thomas Fehring of Whitefish Bay is currently working on ""Chronicles of Mechanical Engineering,"" which will be published this month by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.  Peter Kendall is a former Milwaukeean. He is currently helping to organize the Pitch Pit, a multipurpose communications forum in the new Marquette University School of Business.

The Biden administration is considering invoking a Cold War-era national security law to force companies in the semiconductor supply chain to provide information on inventory and sales of chips, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said Thursday.
The goal is to alleviate bottlenecks that have idled U.S. car production and caused shortages of consumer electronics and to identify possible hoarding, she said in an interview.
Her team for months has sought clarity into how companies allocate their semiconductor supply. But previous meetings that convened firms from different industrial sectors haven’t led to increased transparency and many companies have refused to hand over business data to the government.
The Commerce Department is now asking companies to fill out questionnaires within 45 days providing supply chain information. The request is voluntary but Raimondo said she warned industry representatives that she might invoke the Defense Production Act or other tools to force their hands if they don’t respond.
“What I told them is, ‘I don’t want to have to do anything compulsory but if they don’t comply, then they’ll leave me no choice,’” she said. “I said today we’re evaluating all of our options right now, all the tools. I hope not to go there but we need to see some progress and we definitely need compliance.”
The production act gives the president broad authority to direct industrial production in crises. The Trump and Biden administrations each invoked it to hasten the production and distribution of coronavirus vaccines and other pandemic-related medical supplies.
It isn’t clear precisely how Raimondo might use the law to obtain information from semiconductor manufacturers or their customers, and she didn’t name any specific companies.

A global shortage of chips that power everything from laptops to automobiles has continued to affect production in many industries, and finding medium- and long-term solutions has been a priority since President Joe Biden took office.
U.S. officials have repeatedly emphasized that the private sector must step up and provide more transparency if the government is to successfully address the shortage.
The Commerce chief and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese held meetings with companies Thursday to stress that point again. Raimondo said the first session “went very well” and participants were “extremely constructive.”
The information request -- and potential enforcement through DPA or other means -- is necessary because there’s a lack of trust among companies in the supply chain, she said. 
“There’s allegations of certain consuming companies buying two or three times what they need and stockpiling,” Raimondo said. “So suppliers say, ‘We can’t get a handle on an accurate demand signal because consumers are stockpiling, so we don’t know what the accurate demand is.’ Some consumers are saying ‘We can’t get straight answers from suppliers, how come I was told I could have X and now I’m being told I can only have half of X?’”
Forcing companies to reveal details of their stockpiles would be of interest to investors. One of the biggest concerns about the industry’s massive run-up in revenue and earnings is that chip users are panic buying more than they need and that the resulting accumulation of unused inventory will cause a crash.

The issues facing the supply chain now largely center around the spread of the coronavirus delta variant in Southeast Asian countries like Malaysia and Vietnam, where semiconductor plants had to shut down because of outbreaks and are now operating at reduced capacity.
The Commerce and State Departments, along with embassies, will also set up an early alert system to ensure that virus-related disruptions in production can be addressed faster. The more formal process to react to such shutdowns replaces ad-hoc responses that have occurred over the last six months, a U.S. official said, asking not to be identified discussing private deliberations.

Micron Technology Executive Vice President of Global Operations Manish Bhatia joins Yahoo Finance to discuss how the semiconductor industry has been affected by the supply shortage, the state of demand for products, and the effects of price increases.
Video Transcript
BRIAN CHEUNG: Welcome back to ""Yahoo Finance Live."" The big story at a macro level is the continued supply chain crunch for chip makers. And the largest US maker of memory chips, which is Micron Technology, reported estimate-beating earnings earlier this week. They did guide on the possibility of lower demand from a possible step down in PC customers. So let's get a picture of the complicated supply-demand dynamics in the chip space with the company itself with Manish Bhatia. He's Micron Technology's executive vice president of global operations. Thanks for joining us on the show this morning.
It's interesting because even the likes of Fed Chairman Jay Powell are paying attention to this. He's saying that chips are a big reason why inflation could be high. But he expects that to move down over the course of 2022. So just to start off there, is the outlook for the chip issues with supply and demand also expected, from your vantage point, to alleviate over that time frame?
MANISH BHATIA: Thanks, Brian, and thanks to all of you for having me back on. Yes, you're right, Brian. The unprecedented demand strength across multiple end markets, really synchronized right now as we've started to recover out of the pandemic, has created shortages across different components and parts of the semiconductor supply chain. And we are seeing that that is impacting some of the end market demand and pushing out some of that demand, particularly in the PC market.

 Semiconductor ETFs Soaring to New Heights

Semiconductor ETFs have been rallying this year and are hitting new peaks on several occasions. This is especially true as the pandemic has bolstered demand for chips in leaps and bounds, leading to the worst global shortage in many years.

Semiconductors have been the most important drivers of the overall growth in technology, given the use of chips in day-to-day life from cars, electronic gadgets to planes and weapons. The demand is likely to continue to trend higher given the increased digitization in various corners like healthcare, transport, financial systems, defense, agriculture and retail among others. The rapid adoption of cutting-edge technology like cloud, Internet of Things, autonomous cars, gaming, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies, 5G and other advanced information technologies should continue to fuel growth.

The global semiconductor market is expected to grow 12.5% year over year to reach $522 billion in 2021, according to the International Data Corporation. Per the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS), the worldwide semiconductor market is expected to surge 25% in 2021 following 6.8% growth in 2020. All major product categories will likely see increases with memory set to register the largest revenue growth of 37.1%, followed by 29.1% growth in the analog segment and 26.2% in logic (read: 4 Chip ETFs You Should Not Ignore).

Further, the semiconductor space has also been witnessing mergers and acquisitions, providing a boost to stock prices. Advanced Micro Devices AMD has agreed to buy field-programmable chipmaker Xilinx XLNX for $35 billion while Western Digital WDC is planning to merge with Japan’s Kioxia in a deal exceeding $20 billion. Nvidia NVDA is also in the process of acquiring UK-based chip designer Arm Ltd from Japan's SoftBank Group Corp for about $40 billion.

The House Ways and Means Committee outlined plans on Sept. 13, to move the top marginal income rate up a couple of notches to 39.6% and to introduce a 3% surtax on incomes above $5 million. Tax policy is deemed progressive if the chunk of income taken increases with the income of the individual – so wealthy Americans would pay a larger proportion of their income than poorer ones. With a regressive tax policy, lower earners pay a larger percentage of their earnings in tax than wealthier ones.

Lam Research Corp. sold more than $4 billion worth of semiconductor-manufacturing equipment and services in a single quarter for the first time and produced record profit as chip companies continue to cash in amid a global shortage.
Lam LRCX, +0.10% reported fiscal fourth-quarter net income of $1.14 billion, or $7.98 a share, compared with $696.7 million, or $4.73 a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings, which exclude amortization and other items, were $8.09 a share, compared with $4.78 a share in the year-ago period. Revenue rose to $4.15 billion from $2.79 billion in the year-ago quarter.
Analysts surveyed by FactSet had forecast adjusted earnings of $7.59 a share on revenue of $4.03 billion, based on Lam’s forecast of $7 to $8 a share on revenue of $3.75 billion to $4.25 billion.
Lam also produced record revenue and earnings for its full fiscal year. The company reported annual net income of $3.91 billion, or $26.90 a share, on sales of $14.63 billion, easily topping the previous record in the 2018 fiscal year, which produced profit of $2.38 billion on sales of $11.09 billion.
“Lam continued its record performance in the June quarter, capping a fiscal 2021 with more than 45% revenue growth and an increase of over 70% in earnings per share,” Chief Executive Tim Archer said in a statement. “The combination of strong semiconductor demand and rising device complexity is driving higher levels of wafer fabrication equipment investment.”

Lam predicted that strong growth would continue to start a new fiscal year. On a conference call Wednesday afternoon, executives guided for fiscal first-quarter adjusted earnings of $7.60 to $8.60 a share on sales of $4.05 billion to $4.55 billion. Analysts on average were projecting earnings of $7.88 a share on revenue of $4.11 billion heading into the report, according to FactSet.
Shares declined more than 2% in after-hours trading despite the earnings beat, following a 2% gain in the regular session to close at $635. Lam shares have soared 82% in the past year, compared with a 58.8% gain for the PHLX Semiconductor Index SOX, +0.09% and a 36.8% rise by the S&P 500 index SPX, +1.15%.

In a recent column, I drew the parallels between the economic and geopolitical tensions entangling Japan in 1941 and the challenges facing China today.  
The Historical Parallels - 1941 & 2021 CHART BY AUTHOR
PROMOTED
The storyline is cartoonishly simple. In 1941, Japan’s constricted access to a critical resource (oil) led them to launch military action in Southeast Asia and the Pacific (including Pearl Harbor). It also aligned with their expansionist pretensions (they were already in Manchuria and parts of the mainland by then). In 2021, China is feeling similarly constricted for a critical resource (semiconductors), and Beijing’s policy options for addressing this problem might seem to converge with its expansionary tendencies, and its long-term concerns over the status of Taiwan. Could taking over Taiwan also solve the semiconductor problem? China has tried for over two decades to achieve a degree of self-sufficiency in semiconductor technology, with very limited success. Meanwhile, Taiwan has become a dominant power in the global semiconductor industry. Something like 75% of the world’s integrated circuit manufacturing capacity is based there. When it comes to the most advanced fabrication technologies, Taiwan outshines even the U.S. today – for example, 92% of the world’s capacity for the manufacturing “nodes” of 10 nanometers and below is currently located in Taiwan.
Is the prize ripe enough to provoke Beijing to start a war?
Does this construct make sense? Is military action by China, aimed at annexing Taiwan and taking control of Taiwanese semiconductor assets, likely? Is it even feasible?

The short answer is No. War would not solve China’s problem. We should assume that Beijing understands that.
The counterarguments against a military scenario – at least one that is driven by China’s semiconductor constraints – are very strong. The caveats fall into three inter-locking categories:
Technological Issues
Industry Structure Issues
Supply Chain Issues
[In pulling together what follows, I want to acknowledge – and recommend – two particularly valuable sources: 
A Report issued in June 2021 by The White House (& the Department of Commerce for the relevant section on Semiconductors), entitled “Building Resilient Supply Chains, Revitalizing American Manufacturing, and Fostering Broad-Based Growth - 100-Day Review Under Executive Order 14017” 
A Report issued in April 2021 by the Boston Consulting Group and the Semiconductor Industry Association, entitled “Strengthening the Global Semiconductor Supply Chain in an Uncertain Era”]
Technology Challenges
The Japanese had it easy. In 1941, the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) was the fourth-largest exporter of oil in the world, behind the U.S., Iran, and Romania. When Japan invaded Southeast Asia in late 1941 and early 1942, their military strategy was predicated above all upon surprise – to secure these oil fields intact, denying the Dutch or the British the chance to destroy the wells and refineries. Japan was largely successful, and once in possession, could pump the oil without difficulty (until American forces eventually forced them out). It was feasible to take over the assets by force, and maintain them in full operation. The grab worked. 
This is not the case for Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturing facilities (“foundries”). Integrated circuit (IC) fabrication is probably the most complex manufacturing operation ever developed. It is also one of the most fragile, in the sense that it operates with extraordinarily tight tolerances for both the purity of the raw materials, and “the subatomic level of precision” at which many of the steps in the fabrication process are carried out. The technological challenges are severe, and constitute a significant barrier to the success of any hostile takeover. 
Complexity as a Barrier
IC fabrication is “an incredibly complex process, involving hundreds of steps completed over several months” (White House Report). (It is also incredibly expensive – but that is another story. If the solution was simply financial, China might have an easier time of it.) 
There are many stages in the conversion of raw silicon into a finished integrated circuit, as shown in this graphic drawn from the BCG/SIA Report:  
IC Fabrication Process Steps CHART BY BCG/SIA

This is not a single-loop process. Stages 1 through 4 here may be “repeated hundreds of times with different chemicals to create more layers, depending on the desired circuit features” (BCG/SIA). For the most advanced IC fab techniques, it takes 2 to 3 months to complete the fabrication of a wafer. 
The complexity is challenging even for the industry leaders, who have decades of experience. Even Intel, the largest semiconductor company in the world by sales, and generally regarded as the inventor of the first commercially available microprocessor IC’s, has stumbled in its manufacturing program, falling behind Taiwan Semiconductor Mftg Corp. and Samsung in the development of the latest generation of chip fabrication technologies. 
This is not a plug-and-play business. There is an immense amount of human know-how and expert technical skill involved in operating this mega-machine. Even if China were to find itself in intact possession of the physical infrastructure in Taiwan’s foundries tomorrow, would they know how to run it on their own? Of course not. They don’t have the experience. (Mainland Chinese IC companies have been frantic to recruit Taiwanese experts to help get their operations going.) Following a takeover, the new Chinese owners would still be heavily reliant upon the highly-skilled Taiwanese workforce they had just “annexed.” It takes little imagination to see how disaffection, or outright defection, of key employees could become the proverbial monkey wrench. The cotton fields in Xinjiang may be workable with forced labor, but an IC foundry is not. 
Fragility As A Barrier: The Challenge of the “11 Nines”
Every stage of IC fabrication is based on extremely tight tolerances. This applies to the raw materials, all the inputs to the production process, “ultra pure gases, ultra pure water” - even the electricity must be ultra-reliable. The entire process must take place in “cleanrooms” –  
“Typical ambient room air contains 35,000,000 particles for each cubic meter in the size range 0.5 μm or larger while an ISO 1 cleanroom permits no particles in that size range and just 12 particles for each cubic meter of 0.3 μm and smaller.” (Wikipedia)
  The extreme purity required for the silicon wafers is indicative:
“The semiconductor chain begins with polysilicon of ultra-high purity – 99.99999999999 percent pure… often referred to as “11 Nines” – with impurities equal to just one grain of sand in 16 Olympic-sized swimming pools.” - White House Report
In other words, two grains of sand, or 13 specs of dust (so to speak) will bring down the house. Leaving aside the possibility of sabotage, as well as the sort of disruptions that occur in military operations, or indeed with management changes of any kind, the traditional “happy with crappy” approach of many mainland Chinese manufacturers is not likely to mesh well with these super-tight tolerances. 
All in all, transferring an IC fabrication facility and capability under the conditions of a Chinese takeover would not be a turn-key proposition. 

 Industry Structure Issues
Although it is often referred to as if it were a monolithic category, the Semiconductor industry includes companies with very different business models. A very simplified breakdown into the key sub-sectors is shown here. (There will be a more detailed column on this coming soon.) 
Semiconductor Industry Structure CHART BY AUTHOR

All of these functions must interact to produce an integrated circuit, and all these businesses are thus mutually dependent. Control of one segment is not enough to constitute self-sufficiency. For that, a country would need to have a strong presence in all of these segments. A rundown of the current national positioning in these segments would show the following:
Design: This segment creates 50% of the total value added to a chip (according to the BCG/SIA report). The U.S. dominates the Design segment (e.g., the fabless IC companies like Qualcomm and Nvidia and many others). China has virtually no foothold.
Fabrication (Foundries): This segment creates 24% of the value-added. It is dominated by Taiwan (principally Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., TSMC). China is trying to become a player, but they are several generations behind the leader and have only a very small market share.
Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment: This is the most tech-intensive segment, and accounts for 11% of the value-added. It is dominated by the U.S., with significant shares also held by Japanese and one Dutch company. China has no real share of this market.
Assembly/Packaging/Test: This is the most commoditized segment, providing just 6% of the value-added. China has a modest presence in this business.  
Thus, even if we imagine that Taiwan’s presence in the foundry segment were to flip over, or be absorbed, without impairment, into the Chinese semiconductor economy, that would not provide Beijing with the self-sufficiency it wants. Foundries are expensive to build and challenging to operate, but the U.S. has the inherent capability to do it. It would be painful but we could cope. China as yet lacks the means to develop the Design and Manufacturing Equipment capabilities — without which the foundries cannot function. 
In other words, if there were to be a complete break – or, as the wonks like to put it nowadays, if there were a “decoupling” of the global semiconductor supply chain – which would hurt everyone, a lot, at least for a while – the U.S. would be in a better position to adjust than China would be.
Supply Chain Challenges
The reference to the global supply chain raises the third strategic obstacle to any plan to “solve” China’s semiconductor problem by annexing Taiwan and its foundries. As the White House Reports states, “The supply chains for semiconductor manufacturing are immense.” 
The micro-level technological fragility of the fabrication facility described above is mirrored at the macro-level by the tremendous complexity of the semiconductor supply chain, and the corresponding vulnerability of many of the linkages in those networks. The White House Report zeroes in on one example, involving one input category (chemicals) and one IC type (memory chips):
“Aside from the immediately apparent inputs such as wafers and photomasks, the manufacturing of semiconductors requires hundreds of chemicals and dozens of gases. A 2018 study of chemical use in two memory device fabrication facilities found they each used over 400 chemical products weighing over 45,000 tons per year. As many as 49 gases alone may be used in semiconductor production. Many of these chemicals have their own extensive supply chains that may depend on limited or single sources of supply.” 
The networks created to support the production of a single IC can be vast. According to an Accenture report published in 2020 - 
“Each segment of the semiconductor value chain has, on average, 25 countries involved in the direct supply chain and 23 countries involved in supporting market functions. In fact, a semiconductor product could cross international borders approximately 70 or more times before finally making it to the end customer.”
  Individual companies are enmeshed in these networks to an astonishing degree of dependency.
“The Semiconductor Industry Association notes that one of its members has over 16,000 suppliers, more than half outside the United States.” – White House Report
Autarky Is Impossible
The conclusion – that is, the rational conclusion – is that the military solution would not work for China. The Taiwanese dominance of the foundry segment is a very important feature of the semiconductor industry and indeed of the 21st century digital economy. But it is not a standalone asset, viewed from a macro perspective. It is part of a globalized eco-system that China cannot really escape from. Nor is it, as shown, a turn-key-able asset, a fungible capability that could easily be placed under “new management” in the event of a military takeover. The technological and logistical complexity of this critical sector invalidate any theory of “semiconductor autarky” or full self-sufficiency, certainly for China – and probably also for the U.S. (a caveat for the CHIPS bill and other measures gestating in Congress right now). 
[A hypothetical estimate of the cost of creating “fully self-sufficient supply chains” in semiconductors in each region – Asia, US, Europe – “would have required at least $1 trillion in incremental upfront investment, resulting in a 35-65% overall increase in semiconductor prices and ultimately higher costs of electronic devices for end users.” – from the BCG/SIA Report.]
The Blunder Factor
Chinese President Xi Jinping speaks during a joint presser after a bilateral meeting with his ... [+] AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES
What about an irrational conclusion? That is a risk, admittedly, given the recent pattern of erratic, unnecessary and self-defeating blunders that China under Xi Jinping has fallen into. Whether the neutering of the Hong Kong financial market, the belligerent bullying counterproductive wolf-warrior diplomacy, the disgraceful practice of economic hostage taking, the culture-icide being carried out against the Uighurs, the pointless skirmishing with India in the high Himalayas, the declaration of war against the Chinese tech success stories like Alibaba and DiDi… well, the point is obvious. Is there a chance that Beijing might misunderstand the nature of the semiconductor industry badly enough to prompt a military adventure with the aim of “acquiring” the Taiwanese foundry assets? It wouldn’t work, but perhaps the historical parallels we started out with should not be completely discounted.

This week’s podcast: AI is different from traditional computing, and it is stressing supporting technology in entirely new ways. That goes not only for processors (as one might expect), but also for memory chips. This week, a conversation with Steven Woo of Rambus, on the special challenges of AI.
[FULL TRANSCRIPT AVAILABLE BELOW]
BRIAN SANTO: I’m Brian Santo, EE Times editor-in-chief. You’re listening to EE Times On Air, and this is the Weekly Briefing for the week ending October 1st.
  With the introduction of practical artificial intelligence, there was an enormous leap in the size of problems that people could tackle. Those using AI are eager to process oceans of data. Now, the demands on processors have changed, and that’s why we’ve seen an explosion of startups that make specialized AI processors and AI accelerators. But having to handle so much data has also created new demands on memory ICs.
  The pattern in the semiconductor industry has generally been this: Chip companies figure out ways to improve their products, and then it’s up to their customers figure out how to take advantage of the improvements.
  Nowadays, chip designers can anticipate the improvements they’ll be able to make in the future, and communicate that to their customers, who can figure out how to take advantage of those improvements before they even have physical product in their hands. Now it all seems almost simultaneous, but it isn’t. The pattern is still the pattern; it’s just been accelerated and condensed.
  AI has actually changed the pattern. The problems that AI can address are exponentially larger, and that’s putting a new and unusual stress on semiconductor companies.
  This week our guest is Steven Woo of Rambus, which specializes in memory ICs. Here’s Woo talking about how AI has changed the dynamic in the market:
  STEVEN WOO: Over the last five or six years, when the market was really demanding and more companies were coming to us, we really would go into customer meetings, and we would generally start with, Okay, well so why don’t you tell me how much performance you need. What’s the desired performance level? And we were hearing something that was really unusual. We would often hear, You just can’t give us what we really need. So why don’t you tell us what you think you can do, and then we’ll design the rest of our chip around that. And so it was quite a shock.
  BRIAN SANTO: In a moment we’ll get back to the full interview with Steven Woo of Rambus. First, here’s a quick rundown of some of the stories you can find in EE Times this week
  *Tesla and some Chinese automotive manufacturers are still bulling ahead developing autonomous driving systems for passenger vehicles, despite growing safety concerns. Other companies are taking a more measured approach to autonomous driving. A startup called Plus is one of those. The company is planning on providing autonomous trucking, focusing on the middle-mile segment of the trucking business, which is to say, it will be largely restricting its vehicles to highways, which for many reasons are easier for autonomous systems to navigate. We’ve got a story on Plus and its plans.
  *We also take another look at the ongoing fallout from the devastating SolarWinds hack. It turns out that the irreversible trend toward cloud computing is creating all sorts of security vulnerabilities. Read our analysis.
  *The COVID pandemic keeps lingering, kept going in part by people who reject the ideas that spreading disease is a bad thing, coupled with a lack of enough vaccine to go around the world. Technological countermeasures are certainly needed. I’d like to recommend a story by EE Times editor George Leopold called, “At Last, AI Joins the Fight Against COVID.”
  *About six months ago, vaccines became available. Back then, with vaccines in hand, the world assumed that would be safe to start going back to in-person events right about now. Perhaps it is, but with the delta variation, every foray to a live conference requires a separate calculation of risk. Some of the editors of EE Times have decided to venture back on the road. One is Nitin Dahad.
  Nitin recently attended 5G World in London, near where he lives, and there he ran into Mischa Dohler, Chair Professor of Wireless Communications at King’s College London. Dohler is also associated with a program called 6G Futures, which promotes the development of 6G Technology in the U.K. Nitin asked Dohler about that work.
  NITIN DAHAD: So could you explain to us why do we need 6G?
  MISCHA DOHLER: Look, telecoms works on a few fundamental laws. So think of them like Moore’s Laws, right? So if you look at how data rate increases from generation to generation, something is always multiplied by an order of magnitude. Now if you start putting numbers together and you try to understand the data density which is being produced by the systems, you see that 5G is producing something like 10 terabits per second per square kilometer. If you do the math for 6G following these trends, you end up with 10 petabytes per second per square kilometer.
  So the big question arises, who’s going to use that data? Who’s going to absorb it? Who’s going to generate that? And this is when we started looking at, why do we really need it? Who’s going to be there? And now, of course, I don’t have a crystal ball. But my hunch is that machines will require quite a lot of data rate. And I think really, that very discrete designing of service by humans for humans, or by humans for machines will come to an end in 6G, where machines will design services for themselves. So they will, rather than having very discrete spectrum of services, we will have a continuous spectrum of very volatile services.
  NITIN DAHAD: And so then, you talked about the self-synthesizing networks here. Tell us a little bit about how that’s going to be enabled in 6G.
  MISCHA DOHLER: One of the big challenges we have in telecoms is that it takes us so long to get something from idea to the market, right? So research takes time, you know, granted, but then, you know, the prototyping, the standardization, the deployment takes between eight and 10 years. And it seems like with every generation, it always takes the same time.
  A while back, I asked myself a question: What about replacing the design of the network, but with AI. So not humans doing this, but actually artificial intelligence starting to design its own network components. Now this is very different from zero-touch networks or self-organizing networking practicums, where humans design a network, and then machines configure them. In this case, self-synthesizing networks are designing themselves. So they’re self-evolving. My dream is really to be able to get networks deployed from research to actual use by consumers, maybe within months, possibly days and long-term, even seconds.
  NITIN DAHAD: Well, and I think that’s part of the work you’re doing with the 6G Futures. Is that right?
  MISCHA DOHLER: Very true, sir. We founded 6G Futures to work on these challenging areas like self-synthesizing networks, human-centric networks, live fi how to get this into the architecture. And we have founded this with a few universities, with Bristol, Dimitra, with Howard from Strathclyde, and many more universities are now joining, as well as industry. And, of course, we are having endorsement, hopefully, you know, by the government and other international partners.
  NITIN DAHAD: That’s good. And now, we have written about that. So encourage our listeners to read that. But now, a little bit more flippant. You talked about Where is all this G going to end?
  MISCHA DOHLER: You know, I have to admit, I made a prediction that 5G will be our last G. Why? Because I’ve seen we have software-ized the ecosystem. And I thought it would be straightforward then to innovate in features rather than in big blocks of whatever we do in the G generations. However, I have underestimated the amount of work it takes to actually innovate. To get a research idea into something you can deploy in production, so it works with the consumers. So that’s why I came up with this idea of self-synthesizing networks.
  So I think it will probably take us to 7G to kind of consolidate that. And therefore I think 7G, 8G will probably be our last G, but this time for real.
  NITIN DAHAD: Mischa Dohler, thank you very much.
  MISCHA DOHLER: Thank you.
  BRIAN SANTO: That was EE Times editor Nitin Dahad, with Mischa Dohler of King’s College London, recorded at 5G World in London.
  If you are already on this podcast episode’s web page, look to your left and you’ll see links to all the stories I mentioned a moment ago. You can also go straight to eetimes.com, where you can get details on all of these stories, along with all our other coverage.
  Artificial intelligence is not one thing. If you install an AI out there in the world, it’s probably small, and lonely, and it has few resources to work with, but it probably doesn’t need much to figure out whether a fruit tree is or is not being preyed upon by pests, or if it would be useful for some particular traffic light to change color at any given moment. As a matter of fact, we discussed that type of situation two podcasts ago with Chris Catterton with the company Micro.AI.
  One of the other extremes is training, which typically involves bringing an AI to the point where it can look at an x-ray and issue a likely diagnosis, or to determine if a particular molecule might be the basis for an effective medicine.
  Computing had always been about taking the data and doing something with it, and then outputting the result. Training an AI for something as complex as the types of applications I just spoke about is about taking amounts of data that are enormous, voluminous, vast — brobdingnagian! — and going over it again and again, until the model produces the desired results. Those data sets have to be stored somewhere at hand, which means IC memory, and usually a lot of it. And AI applications create some unique demands for getting to it.
  Rambus has been developing innovative memory ICs and associated technology for years. Steven Woo is a Rambus Fellow and Distinguished Inventor. We recently sat down with Woo to talk about AI and memory chips.
  We’ve been talking at EE Times about co-processors and processors. And systems architectures even sometimes. But there’s a profound effect that a lot of people don’t realize on memory chips. And that’s where Rambus comes in. I was wondering if you could tell us what it is about AI, what’s going on in AI and how it affects memory.
  STEVEN WOO: Absolutely. Yeah. At Rambus, we’ve been in the memory business for several decades. And what we see is that AI in particular is an important driving application now for the development of new memory technologies. It turns out that some of these AI engines that you see from companies like Nvidia and others, they really require the fastest memories. And there’s a few reasons for that.
  One is these models that are being implemented today to do things like natural language processing, image recognition, and recommendation, they just require very, very large models. And so for one, you need just a lot of storage to support those models.
  The other thing is that AI engines require a lot of examples to learn from. And it turns out that these large models that are complex, they require lots and lots of training data. And so what we’re seeing is that the size of these models is growing at more than 10x per year. And of course, when those models are growing at more than 10x per year, you also have a growth in the amount of training data.
  And so if you kind of look at that, and you say, Wow! The sizes of these things are growing so fast. That’s really faster than any other semiconductor technology trend. And so the natural thing that you have to think about is, Where do I store all this? And it’s really memory.
  And in addition to the capacity, you have to really be able to push that data very quickly so that you can train things quickly and you can move that data quickly. So bandwidth becomes a really important issue as well.
  And finally, the third part of that is really the power efficiency. You don’t want to spend infinite power, and you have to think a lot about how to budget that power that’s there. You want a lot of it to be in the core computational part of that engine.
  Data movement is starting to become a big limiter now in terms of performance and power efficiency. So there’s a lot of challenges there on the memory side to try to really meet the needs of these greater amount of data for AI.
  BRIAN SANTO: Is it just a matter of drawing the data in? Or is there like a feedback iteration? Do you end up processing the data, feeding it back, drawing it back later? Does it loop?
  STEVEN WOO: Yeah, absolutely. So it turns out in the training process, what’s interesting about it is, it’s very iterative. So you have this training set. And what you do is, you repeatedly present it to the AI engine, and it gets better and better at recognizing the things you want it to recognize. It’s kind of like if you had a stack of flashcards and you were trying to learn a new language or something, you would just iteratively go through your stack of flashcards over and over again. And eventually you’d get better at recognizing all of the words and phrases that you’re trying to train yourself to understand.
  And really, AI works in a very similar way. We just try and repeatedly present the information. And what happens is, those computations are constantly adjusting the parameters of the neural network. So it begins to home in on making the correct answers across the entire training set as accurate as you can be.
  But you might imagine that process of just repeatedly going through the flashcards, people want to go faster and faster. And the flashcard deck can be very, very large. And so it’s really about pushing a lot of data very, very quickly through the neural network so that it can adjust and learn its task.
  BRIAN SANTO: A moment ago, you used a two-word phrase that was interesting: new memory. And that could mean two different things, or several different things perhaps, but in my mind, I was thinking, new versions of existing memory. So can we improve SRAM and flash and especially DRAM, I imagine?
  And then there’s the other thing of emerging memories. Memories, like FRAM and MRAM, reRAM, different architectures and spins on the technology that people were anticipating might become useful. So let me ask you first about improving the memory we have. And then where some of these emerging memories fit in.
  STEVEN WOO: Sure, yeah. So let me address the first part first here, which is, if you look today at some of the toughest kinds of problems that people try and do in the data center, we’re talking about training large models. And it turns out that there’s really three kinds of memory that people use. The first is on-chip SRAM. And on-chip SRAM is really great. It’s very, very high bandwidth. You can get many tens of terabytes a second of bandwidth on a standard reticle-sized die. And it’s also extremely power efficient. But the real challenge there is that capacity can be a challenge.
  So it turns out that on a standard reticle-sized die, you can get a few hundred megabytes of capacity. And if that’s good enough for your problem, then boy, on-chip memory is a great solution for you.
  But what we find is that, with these growth rates I mentioned where the models are growing at more than 10x per year and the data set sizes are large as well, what we find is that more and more people are really turning to the fastest kinds of DRAMS that are available. So HBM and GDDR. And it turns out HBM is kind of a newer type of…
  BRIAN SANTO: HBM: High bandwidth memory.
  STEVEN WOO: That’s correct, yes. It’s high bandwidth memory. And it’s a kind of memory that involves stacking, not only within the DRAM component, but stacking of the components together. So the DRAMS and the processors. It involves some extra components of silicon substrate. And what it does, though, is it uses a very large number of wires on the order of 1024 wires between each DRAM device and the processor. And these wires are very finely spaced. And what you can do to get the high bandwidth there is, you actually don’t have to run the data rate very high when you have that many wires.
  And so what it does is, it ends up being very power-efficient. And it ends up being pretty area-efficient as well. Just the challenge is that it’s more difficult to design because of the stacking, and it can be more expensive. And so if you can tolerate that cost, and if you have the engineering skill to be able to implement the solution, it is a great choice, especially if you need external DRAM.
  The other option here is a GDDR, or graphics DRAM, and this kind of memory has been around for a couple of decades. It was originally developed for the graphics market, still used very widely among the GPU manufacturers. But what it has is, it has kind of the more traditional manufacturing approach, where it’s a packaged device that you put on a PCB. It uses kind of more traditional manufacturing technologies. So if you find that you can’t quite tolerate the cost or the complexity of doing something like HBM, then GDDR is a great choice for you.
  So we see a number of choices here. And really most everyone’s gravitating now towards HBM and GDDR because they need the capacity of the external DRAM.
  BRIAN SANTO: Okay.
  STEVEN WOO: That’s what’s going on in the DRAM world. And then you asked about some of these other emerging memories and things. And I think really what’s going on there is, some of the emerging memories very, very interesting technology, but it’s still pretty early days for this kind of technology, still a number of challenging manufacturing and reliability issues to work through. They do have some interesting promise. But there also are some things about the emerging memories. Some of the issues like endurance, for example, high write currents and things like that. They make it a little bit harder to use widely in a lot of different kinds of systems.
  So I would say the industry is working very hard to try and address some of these things. But I think for now DRAM is going to remain the dominant kind of technology that we’ll be seeing in a lot of these AI engines going forward.
  BRIAN SANTO: Now, the story arc, as I understand it, was that these emerging technologies do in fact have some intriguing properties that might bring some benefits. But they were also anticipating that standard-type memories — DRAM and its variants — would hit a wall someplace. And there was that expectation at some point. And apparently folks have done some incredible innovation in DRAM. Is that an accurate evaluation of the wider trend?
  STEVEN WOO: Yeah, I think that’s right. A lot of the work that’s been done on some of these emerging memories, they do have some pretty fascinating characteristics. For example, non volatility is a really good one, and certainly the ability to use them as kind of an analog-type of computing cell, make them very attractive, because it’s extremely dense computation that’s happening in parallel.
  There are some manufacturing-related issues like resistance drift, and there’s other things as well, like longer-term reliability, that kind of make them challenging. And then in parallel, DRAM has been around for many decades, and the industry has a lot of embedded knowledge on how to improve DRAM. And so it’s kind of this moving target, that you’re always trying to see if you can be better than.
  And the DRAM industry continues to make good progress. So I think for now, what we see is that DRAM continues to make enough good strides forward. And it continues to have the right balance between the various kind of performance parameters and characteristics that make it still the right choice, especially in the data center. What we see is that it will be the dominant technology for the next several years, but the industry will continue to try and work on alternatives, which makes it very exciting to be part of the industry.
  BRIAN SANTO: That brings up an interesting side note. I think we’ve had people on this podcast and in the pages EE Times, and I’m sure you’ve talked to some folks who are worried about the end of Moore’s Law. It’s slowing, if nothing else, and yet every time somebody thinks that silicon is dead, they managed to eke a little more out of it. Literally, we’re getting close to atomic level and physical limits there. What one way do you see left with silicon and DRAM and silicon?
  STEVEN WOO: Yeah, it’s a really good question. There are a lot of smart people in the world. And what they’ve shown…
  BRIAN SANTO: I know! Almost everybody I talk to is smarter than me. So you don’t need to tell me that.
  STEVEN WOO: I think what’s fun about the industry is that the industry rises to the challenge. And what I would say is that, over the past couple of decades, there have been substantial concerns about slowing of Moore’s Law and the eventual end of Moore’s Law. And the way we see it is yes, it is true that things are slowing down a bit. But we do see very compelling roadmaps from the industry that seem to indicate that things will continue forward.
  Now, maybe it’s not at the same rate as before, and maybe it might be challenging on the manufacturing side to keep that expense the same. But there are paths forward. And so what we see is the continued ability to shrink and to get to better process geometries. It will continue, but maybe slow a bit.
  Now the other part of that equation, though, is something we touched on earlier, which is data movement itself is beginning to be the problem. And so some of our own analysis shows that if you have like a HBM, a high bandwidth memory device, DRAM, talking to an SOC, it turns out that the power to read and write to that device and move data back and forth, it turns out only a third of the power is really spent getting the bits out of the DRAM core where the data is stored. It turns out, about two thirds of the power is spent moving the data just between the two chips. Between the processor and the memory. And so you can see, the limiter is starting to be that movement of the data.
  And so if you press in a little bit more to figure out why that is, what you see is that the distance that you have to move the data, it’s on the order of 10 millimeters or so. And so it turns out that there’s a direct correlation between that distance and the amount of power you spend. So people look at that and say, Well, how do I reduce that distance? And the natural way to think about it is to go to stacking.
  So if I could put the memory you in the same stack with the processor, what I can do is, I can cut down maybe from 10 millimeters that I’m moving the data to really just tens of microns. And so now we’re talking about a pretty dramatic improvement in that distance. And we think that two-thirds of the pie where you’re spending all this power, we think we can cut that down by about an order of magnitude. So tremendous improvement in the data movement power, and you get a commensurate improvement in performance as well.
  BRIAN SANTO: Wow. Phenomenal. Part of it is the memory functionality itself. But as you said, part of the bottleneck seems to be just the shuttling of data back and forth. And so it sounds like one of the answers is innovative packaging approaches. Architecturally, are there other ways of addressing that issue of moving data back and forth?
  STEVEN WOO: Yeah. That’s a good question. Really, what we’ve seen, especially in the AI space, is that there have been really innovative approaches to re-architecting. And really thinking differently about the architectures of AI engines. And so building architectures that are very specific to the computation and data movement patterns within AI.
  And so a lot of these really interesting designs — just to name a few, the Google TPU, for example, is a really good example, or you see solutions from people like Cerebrus, Graphcore. They’re really about trying to minimize the data movement. And when you do bring data from off-chip onto your chip, you’re trying to use it just as many times as possible. You want that high reuse so that you can amortize the high cost of getting the data, through many reuses.
  That’s one side of it. And really, the other part of it is, if you think about the whole AI processing pipeline, there are things just to feed the AI engines, where you’re trying to minimize data movement there and you’re trying to improve the rest of that pipeline so that doesn’t become the bottleneck.
  BRIAN SANTO: I’ve heard tell of CXL. Explain what CXL is, and put it in context for us.
  STEVEN WOO: Sure. Yeah, it actually dovetails nicely to what I just mentioned here.
  BRIAN SANTO: Yeah, I knew that. But I figured I’d lob the softball.
  STEVEN WOO: Okay, yeah. And so what’s CXL is, it’s a new kind of interconnect standard. It’s called the Compute Express Link. And what it does is, it has multiple functions really. One thing that it allows you to do is it allows you to take processors and connect them with things like accelerators and FPGAs, where it allows them to have an ability to do things like share data and to be able to really use whichever engine is most advantageous for it during a particular portion of a computation.
  And where it gets interesting, especially to Rambus, is that CXL also offers the ability to connect memory to a processor. The traditional thing you see today on CPUs is, you have these DIMM slots and you plug DIMM modules in. But what CXL will allow you to do is have another kind of interconnect where we can put memory. And what makes it particularly interesting is that you can actually have servers, for example, that have not only DIMM sockets with memory in them, but these extra CXL links. And that gives you the ability to expand both your memory capacity and your memory bandwidth beyond what you can do today.
  And for something like AI where the processing pipeline depends on a lot of memory capacity — and of course, you have to push that data back and forth, so you need a lot of memory bandwidth — this is a great solution for making sure that the rest of the processing pipeline doesn’t become the bottleneck.
  Further down the line, the other thing that CXL will offer is the ability to disaggregate systems. So today, the way a server’s put together is there’s a fixed amount of resources within the box. There’s some number of CPUs and some number of cores, some amount of memory, some amount of storage. But in the future, what you’ll be able to do with CXL is, you’ll be able to take those resources, and instead of having fixed portions in each server, you’ll be able to have pools of these resources.
  So you might have a box that just has CPUs, you might have a box that has just storage, a box that has just memory. And what’s kind of cool about that is, when a job comes in, you can then go to these pools and grab however much of each of those resources that you need for that job, and you can provision it to that job until it’s done. And when that job is then finished, you can return those resources to the pools and they can then be loaned out and provisioned to a future job in whatever ratios are needed for that particular job.
  And so what we see here is that — especially with AI, with it being so data intensive and so bandwidth-hungry — the ability to tailor what you’re provisioning for a particular workload, will allow you to run an incredibly wide range of workloads, especially in a place like AI, where we’re seeing the diversity of workloads grow each year. It’s a really good match to the growing needs that we see in places like AI.
  BRIAN SANTO: Perhaps I’m just not understanding this well. Or perhaps I’m not understanding data center dynamics very well. I get the disaggregation, why disaggregation within a data center is useful. This has been going on for a while. So they’re able to get shared resources and apportion them and make sure that those resources are churning constantly, instead of lying unused. But if you start physically moving, physically separating memory from processing, you’ve got that distance again. Am I thinking about it wrong?
  STEVEN WOO: Yeah, I think the way you’re thinking about it is right. There is an architectural tug of war between trying to figure out how to provide the maximum flexibility so that you really can have a lot of resources attack a particular problem, versus managing things like the distance that goes on, because the distance requires more power, and it does increase the latency.
  And so what I’d say is, it’s really an active area of research right now. And if you look at some of the newer processors that are coming out, one possibility is that you might have memory that is — some smaller amount of memory — that is attached directly to the CPUs.
  For example, if you look at some of the proposals that are coming from companies like Intel, that memory might actually be able to operate in multiple modes. It might operate more like a cache in some modes, and it might operate more like memory and other modes. And so if it were to operate something like a cache, you might think about having a pool of memory that’s a little bit further away, but be able to get the benefits of reuse by operating the local memory more like a cache.
  So it is a bit of an open issue within the industry. But what’s interesting is that there is this adaptation going on. And so, like many of these kinds of things, having that hardware available will allow the user community to really explore the best ways to use it. And I’m sure there’ll be  more evolution to come. But I think the key is that, all in all, it will allow greater amounts of resources to be thrown at the largest problems that need it, and we’ll be able to achieve higher performance because of it.
  BRIAN SANTO: There are so many different categories of AI problem. Like inference, like training, these enormous data sets. Are there converse concerns implementing systems that can support AI processes that have very sparse data sets?
  STEVEN WOO: Yeah. The thing that’s really interesting about AI is, because of memory capacity limits, and because of concerns about how much bandwidth you really can provide, there has been a lot of work over the years on things like sparse models, where maybe you don’t need to represent every connection, or maybe I can reduce the granularity of some of the numbers that are used to represent the model parameters. And so those kinds of things have been actively studied for quite a while.
  And it turns out that neural networks are pretty tolerant. You really can reduce your precision if you need to, you can introduce sparsity, and it allows you to conserve the resources that are very precious to you like the capacity and the bandwidth that you need. And so I think there is more work that’s going on. It does get better each year.
  And so that’s also an active area of research right now about really what is the best way to train a model that ultimately you want to be sparse. You might think about training it in its full mode first and then past a certain point, you might start to prune it and you might start to introduce sparsity and then continue training from there. It’s an active area of research right now. But it is something that the community is using really as a response to the fact that these resources are very precious.
  BRIAN SANTO: Anything that I haven’t asked about that’s pertinent here?
  STEVEN WOO: I think the key is that, like we talked about, it really is data movement that we’re seeing driving a lot of things. So we talked a lot about memory, but many of these concepts also apply to the chip-to-chip, the processor-to-processor connections as well.
  These days, people in the data center, for example, on these large neural network models, you’re using multiple chips to try and train the model. And so there are these points in the training phase where you do have to get everybody to communicate. So it really is many of the same kind of issues. It’s about the bandwidth and the power efficiency and how to make those links faster and really better for the type of task that’s going on. It’s something I alluded to before, which is the compute part of it.
  The industry has done a great job over the last few decades to make that better. And really, memory and interconnects are once again in the spotlight because of this large amount of growing data that we have to able to process.
  So for us, it’s a really interesting time to be in the industry. It’s a great time, actually. And we have a driving set of applications led by AI that’s really helping move our industry forward.
  BRIAN SANTO: That was Steven Woo, a Fellow and Distinguished Inventor at Rambus.
  Artificial intelligence, as I mentioned earlier, is not one thing. Depending on who you talk to, whatever we have today that we’re calling “artificial intelligence” might not even merit that description. You might want to listen to last week’s podcast with Helen Toner, Director of Strategy at Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology. She and EE Times editor George Leopold talk about what safe, reliable AI should look like.
  And speaking of podcasts, inimitable EE Times Maurizio di Paolo Emilio has published his latest Power Up podcast. Shuli Goodman, founder and executive director of LF Energy, a Linux Foundation project, is his guest. They talk about how an open-source approach to power management can be an important means of transforming the global production of energy. This is Shuli Goodman from that episode:
  SHULI GOODMAN: The power system we have today is about 150 years old, and it was created out of a certain kind of mind. And it was created out of a certain kind of consciousness. When I look at what we are facing, to me, we’re in a conflict between, Are we going to transform our consciousness? Or are we going to have catastrophe? And so when I think about open source, I think about open source as a paradigm. It’s really a legal kind of framework that enables cooperation. It’s not complex.
  BRIAN SANTO: You can find the latest Power Up podcasts on our web site at eetimes.com/podcasts, where you’ll also find the Weekly Briefing, the Artificial Intelligence podcast with Sally Ward-Foxton, the Embedded podcast with Nitin Dahad, and our Artful Engineer videos.
  And that concludes this episode of the Weekly Briefing. Thank you for listening.

  BRIAN SANTO: How’s your memory?
  STEVEN WOO: Okay.
  BRIAN SANTO: Is it? The reason I ask is because I’m one of those guys who can be introduced to three people and I always forget names. And you have that thing where you do like… they tell you to do a mnemonic.
  STEVEN WOO: Right.
  BRIAN SANTO: Oh, do a little rhyme or something or other. And I used to do that, and then I’d forget the rhyme. And the name. So are you one of those people who forgets his car keys all over the place?
  STEVEN WOO: Oh yeah, I’m no different. There are definitely things I forget here and there. I’ll tend to forget dates sometimes and things like that. Or I’ll forget where I put something is another pretty classic one for me. Or where I parked my car is a pretty common one for me. I’m like, hmm. Where did I put that thing?
  BRIAN SANTO: They say things like the greatest invention since sliced bread. I say the greatest invention since a little key fob that makes your car make noise.
  STEVEN WOO: Yeah, absolutely. I definitely use that, and I’m one of those guys holding my keys up high above my head in the parking lot trying to get the maximum distance on the chirp. So yeah. That’s definitely me.

Hemlock Semiconductor announces leadership transition
Arabinda ‘AB’ Ghosh to join as COO on Sept. 27 and transition to CEO at end of year, succeeding Mark Bassett
Midland Daily News
Sep. 27, 2021
Comments

Hemlock Semiconductor Operations (HSC), the country’s largest manufacturer of hyper-pure polysilicon used in solar panels and semiconductors, today announced a leadership transition that will begin with the appointment of Arabinda “AB” Ghosh as Chief Operating Officer on Sept. 27.
Current Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mark Bassett plans to retire from the role at year’s end, and Ghosh will assume his responsibilities as chairman and CEO at that time. Bassett will continue to support the company with its growth initiatives and plans to stay involved in the local community. Ghosh joins HSC after a distinguished career as a top executive with Akzo Nobel and Nouryon, global leaders in specialty chemical and coatings manufacturing, where he led business units with revenues of up to $2.4 billion, more than 50 plant locations in multiple countries and more than 6,000 employees.
Bassett has led HSC as CEO since 2016, when HSC became a stand-alone company. Bassett previously had a 26-year career at Dow and Union Carbide.
“AB Ghosh is exceptionally well-qualified to serve as HSC’s next leader and brings a strong portfolio of executive leadership experience and a 30-year track record of success in management and finance roles to his new position,” Bassett stated. “HSC is focused on competitiveness and excellence in the hyper-pure polysilicon market and also seeks to be a sustainable company that energizes and connects our world. AB believes in the vision and in the company culture that has gotten us here. His diversified skill set in managing complex market portfolios and delivering against financial and operational metrics will be an important asset to the company as we continue to strengthen HSC’s position as a global market leader.”
Ghosh began his career as an internal audit manager with Deloitte in England and shortly thereafter joined Courtaulds, a UK-based manufacturer of fabric, clothing, artificial fibers and chemicals, in a group finance role. When the company was acquired by Akzo Nobel in 1998, he quickly moved up the ranks of executive leadership, taking on positions with progressive responsibility for global business units until the company’s specialty chemicals business was sold to The Carlyle Group in 2018 and rebranded as Nouryon. He continued as president and managing director, Global Surface Chemistry for Nouryon until departing at the end of 2019 to pursue consulting opportunities with several of the world’s leading private equity firms.
“I am honored to join the Hemlock family during such an exciting time for the company,” Ghosh stated. “Thanks to Mark’s extraordinary leadership in standing up HSC as an independent company, we are now in a position to leverage tremendous growth opportunities in the domestic market and around the world, driven by a clear and compelling vision based on core principles of quality, sustainability and innovation. I am excited about becoming Hemlock’s next chief executive and believe our company is well-positioned for the future.”
Ghosh and his wife, Tracy, are in the process of relocating from Georgia to their new home in Michigan. The couple has two adult sons. He completed his education in England and received his chartered accountancy from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England & Wales.

ow much a stock's price changes over time is important for most investors, since price performance can both impact your investment portfolio and help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.
Another thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.
What if you'd invested in ON Semiconductor Corp. (ON) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to ON for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?
ON Semiconductor Corp.'s Business In-Depth
With that in mind, let's take a look at ON Semiconductor Corp.'s main business drivers.
ON Semiconductor, now renamed as onsemi, is an original equipment manufacturer of a broad range of discrete and embedded semiconductor components. The company was spun off from Motorola in Aug 1999 and went public through an IPO in May 2000.

onsemi’s product lines include discretes, such as bipolar transistors, diodes, filters, FETs, rectifiers and thyristors.

onsemi’s acquisition of Fairchild Semiconductor International makes it a leader in the power semiconductor space. Moreover, the company’s acquisitions of Cypress Semiconductor’s CMOS Image Sensor Business Unit, SANYO Semiconductor, AMI Semiconductor, Analog Devices’ power PC controller business, CMD, Catalyst, and SoundDesign gave it new technical capabilities, some custom ASIC products, higher-margin products, exposure to new end markets and greater product breadth.

The power management product line includes AC-DC controllers and regulators, DC-DC converters and regulators, drivers, thermal managers, and voltage controllers, references and supervisors.

The logic product line includes clocking, memory, differential logic and standard logic products.

Signal processing products include amplifiers and comparators, analog switches, digital potentiometers, DSP systems and interfaces.

The company also offers custom application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), foundry services and memory products.

Customers include OEMs, electronic manufacturing service (EMS) providers and distributors. Top OEM customers include Motorola, Delta, Hewlett-Packard, Samsung, Siemens, Apple, Dell, Nokia, Intel, Sony, Continental Automotive Systems, DaimlerChrysler, Delphi, TRW and Visteon.

Top distributor customers include Arrow, Avnet, EBV Elektronik, Future, Solomon Enterprise and World Peace. Top EMS customers are Flextronics, Jabil and Celestica.

Phoenix, AZ-based onsemi reported revenues of $5.255 billion in 2020. The company generated 13.9% of total revenues in 2020 from the United States.
Bottom Line
Anyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in ON Semiconductor Corp. ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.
A $1000 investment made in September 2011 would be worth $6,539.75, or a gain of 553.97%, as of September 13, 2021, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.
The S&P 500 rose 286.28% and the price of gold increased -5.37% over the same time frame in comparison.
Analysts are forecasting more upside for ON too.
onsemi reported impressive second-quarter 2021 results with earnings and revenues increasing on a year-over-year basis. The top line benefited from broad-based strength across industrial, computing, consumer and automotive end-markets. onsemi continues to gain traction among electric vehicle manufacturers. It witnessed solid demand environment in the second quarter, particularly for its power and sensing products, which it expects to continue in the near term. However, the company is suffering from supply constraints, especially for certain products that are manufactured by its foundry partners. onsemi expects that the demand will continue to outpace supply through the first half of next year. Shares have outperformed the industry year to date. Nonetheless, a highly leveraged balance sheet remains a concern.

Tech IPOs With Massive Profit Potential: Last years top IPOs surged as much as 299% within the first two months. With record amounts of cash flooding into IPOs and a record-setting stock market, this year could be even more lucrative.

Thailand offers perks to draw semiconductor, digital investments
Reuters
2 minute read
BANGKOK, June 30 (Reuters) - Thailand has offered incentives to attract investment in the growing semiconductor, digital and packaging industries to meet rising global demand amid coronavirus outbreaks, the country's investment agency said on Wednesday.
Front-end capital and technology-intensive manufacturing such as wafer fabrication will be given 10-year tax holidays, the Board of Investment (BOI) said in a statement.
Advanced integrated circuits, IC (integrated circuit) substrate and printed circuit board projects with machinery investment of at least 1.5 billion baht ($46.8 million) will be offered an eight-year tax break, it said.
""The semiconductor industry has experienced demand hike and companies are looking for more resilience in the global supply chain,"" BOI head Duangjai Asawachintachit said.
Companies applying for BOI privileges for software development, digital services platform or digital content will also be eligible for eight-year tax holidays, the BOI said.
Enhanced investment incentives will be offered to so-called smart packaging and environmentally friendly packaging, including recycled materials, it said.

Chipmakers to carmakers: Time to get out of the semiconductor Stone Age

When it comes to the electronic circuits that power our everyday lives, the automobile is simultaneously the world’s most expensive consumer good and the one that runs on the cheapest possible semiconductor chips.

How CareCentrix built a workplace culture based in care
FROM CARECENTRIX
Moore’s law of ever-increasing miniaturization seemingly never reached the automotive industry. Dozens of chips found in everything from electronic brake systems to airbag control units tend to rely on obsolete technology often well over a decade old. These employ comparatively simple transistors that can be anywhere from 45 nanometers to as much as 90 nanometers in size, far too large—and too primitive—to be suitable for today’s smartphones.
When the pandemic hit, replacement demand for big-ticket items like new cars was pushed back while sales of all kinds of home devices soared. When the car market roared back months later, chipmakers had already reallocated their capacity.
Now these processors are in short supply, and chipmakers are telling car companies to wake up and finally join the 2010s.
“I’ll make them as many Intel 16 [nanometer] chips as they want,” Intel chief executive Pat Gelsinger told Fortune last week during his visit to an auto industry trade show in Germany.
Carmakers have bombarded him with requests to invest in brand-new production capacity for semiconductors featuring designs that, at best, were state of the art when the first Apple iPhone launched.  
“It just makes no economic or strategic sense,” said Gelsinger, who came to the auto show to convince carmakers they need to let go of the distant past. “Rather than spending billions on new ‘old’ fabs, let’s spend millions to help migrate designs to modern ones.” 
The ‘why’ of car chips
The brutal cost pressure carmakers exert on their suppliers, which source the chips for their various components, is certainly part of the reason why the processors they use tend to be bulk commodity products. But it isn’t the only one: Reliability plays a major concern. 
Most systems in cars are safety-critical and need to perform in practically every situation regardless of temperature, humidity, vibrations, and even minor road debris. With so much at stake, tried and true is better than new and improved. 
“A lot of it just has to do with the fact that these are proven designs,” explained Gelsinger, who is currently campaigning for subsidies to build the most advanced chip fab in Europe.
Unlike Intel, Qualcomm cannot directly help by investing in the expansion of capacity. Instead the U.S. company is a fab-less chipmaker, meaning it is reliant on dedicated contract manufacturers called foundries that build its semiconductors for it—and that’s precisely where the bottleneck is most acute. 
""For the foundries, investing in the old technology is much less attractive, because sooner or later there will be a migration to the new technology,"" Enrico Salvatori, president of Qualcomm Europe, said in an interview.
He is also working with the car industry to accelerate the transition, but he concedes it’s not an easy fix.
“The new technologies are not pin-to-pin compatible, it’s not plug and play,” Salvatori said. “You have to redesign the circuit, build a new board that might have to be recertified; maybe there’s some impact on the mechanical side that then could affect the car’s chassis. So there is a domino effect of action needed.”
Supply crunch
The first warning signs over a coming chip supply crunch came in December 2020, but the problems were initially expected to only affect car production for a short period of time, as chipmakers turned their production back toward the automakers. Lead times of six months are often required as the nanoscopic circuitry on a chip is printed on silicon substrates in a series of painstakingly long production steps that require weeks.
The shortage only became acute following a chain of unrelated events that limited supplies of raw chip wafers right at the source. First, a winter cold snap caused rolling blackouts at Texas chip fabs operated by Infineon, NXP, and Samsung, before a freak fire in March at key Japanese supplier Renesas compounded the problem. Finally a COVID outbreak brought downstream supply to a halt in Malaysia and Vietnam, a low-wage hub where chips are packaged into finished products for final shipping.
As a result, as many as 9.4 million cars, or more than a tenth of the industry’s pre-pandemic output, could be eliminated from production plans, according to market research firm AutoForecast Solutions.
“Because of a 50-cent chip, we are unable to build a car that sells for $50,000,” said Murat Aksel, head of procurement for Volkswagen Group, during a press briefing in Munich last week. 
If semiconductor suppliers like Intel and Qualcomm have their way, however, the days of the auto industry relying on these cheap commodity chips are numbered.

Senate Bill Would Create Semiconductor Manufacturing Tax Credit
New legislation introduced by Sens. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, would create a 25 percent tax credit for investments in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing to boost domestic manufacturing of semiconductors and further the aims of a major push in Congress to stimulate domestic growth in that sector.
Introduction of the Facilitating American-Built Semiconductors (FABS) Act follows by the Senate earlier this month of the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act (USICA) of 2021, championed by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.

NY officials grow optimistic about luring semiconductor chip plant to Clay, lawmaker says

Onondaga County is marketing its White Pine Commerce Park in Clay to semiconductor manufacturers. The 1,250-acre site is in a prime spot near high-capacity water, power and sewage lines needed for a chip plant. Rick Moriarty | rmoriarty@syracuse.com

Onondaga County believes it is close to striking a deal to land a semiconductor chip manufacturer that would invest billions of dollars to open a plant in Clay and employ 3,000 to 5,000 people, a state lawmaker said.
The chip manufacturers are expected to decide by the end of 2021 whether they want to build at White Pine Commerce Park in Clay, Stirpe said.
U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said in April that three of the world’s major semiconductor makers told him that White Pine is in the running to host a chip plant.
McMahon said last year that the site was a finalist in 2019 for a $12 billion semiconductor plant to be built by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., one of the world’s top semiconductor makers.
Now the global chip shortage, worsened by the coronavirus pandemic, has renewed interest among semiconductor makers to build factories in the United States. The chips are used in computers, smartphones, cars and household appliances.
Schumer, the Senate majority leader, led a bipartisan group of senators in June who approved an unprecedented investment of $52 billion in federal incentives for chip manufacturers to open new domestic plants.
OCIDA voted 5-0 to use its eminent domain powers to finish acquiring the final 100 acres needed to expand the park to 1,250 acres.
He said the state wants to avoid a repeat of the backlash to government subsidies that prompted Amazon to cancel its plans in February 2019 for a corporate campus in New York City that would have employed 25,000 people.

Semiconductor firms can’t find enough workers, worsening chip shortage
Material costs are rising too, and the shortage will continue into 2022.

The semiconductor chip shortage that has so vexed the auto industry looks set to continue for quite some time, according to a new industry survey. More than half of the companies that were surveyed by IPC said they expected the shortage to last until at least the second half of 2022. And right now, the chip shortage is being exacerbated by rising costs and a shortage of workers.
According to the survey, 80 percent of chip makers say that it's become hard to find workers who have to be specially trained to handle the highly toxic compounds used in semiconductor manufacturing. The problem is worse in North America and in Asia, where more companies are reporting rising labor costs compared to those in Europe.
But only a third of Asian chip makers say they are finding it harder to find qualified workers, compared to 67 percent of North American companies and 63 percent of European companies. That may well explain why fewer Asian semiconductor companies (42 percent) are reporting increasing order backlogs, compared to 65 percent of North American and 60 percent of European companies.

Just under half (46 percent) said they were retraining their current workers to fill the gaps, and nearly as many (44 percent) said they were increasing wages to make the jobs more attractive. Other popular measures include more flexible hours and more training opportunities for workers.
Even more of the companies surveyed said that rising material costs were a problem, too—90 percent globally, with nearly as many suggesting that trend will continue for another six months at least. IPC says that chip makers' profit margins are shrinking as a result.
That's probably already being felt by some of their customers. According to a report by AlixPartners, the auto industry will lose out on $210 billion in revenue in 2021, forecasting a shortfall in production of 7.7 million vehicles worldwide. That's got the US government's attention, too. On Thursday, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo is meeting automakers and tech firms, as well as semiconductor companies, to see if the federal government can help.

ASML Holdings NV (NASDAQ:ASML), a provider of lithography machines needed to manufacture semiconductor chips, and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), a manufacturer of memory needed in all types of technology from cellphones to automobiles, recently announced some significant updates. Today's video focuses on recent news affecting ASML and Micron, current valuations for both companies, and an update on the current semiconductor market. Here are some highlights from the video:
On Sept. 29, during its investors day presentation, ASML provided an update to its investors. Based on the strength in numerous markets in the semiconductor industry, ASML expects to reach annual revenue of 24 billion euros to 30 billion euros, with gross margins of 55% at the midpoint by 2025.  
ASML expects to provide significant returns to investors in the form of share buybacks and growing dividends. Between Sept. 20 and Sept. 24, ASML reported buying back over 50,000 shares each day. ASML's stock price on Wednesday, Sept. 29, is lower than the price ASML paid the week before. 
On Tuesday, Sept. 28, Micron Technologies reported its fourth-quarter earnings after the market closed. Unfortunately, investors were not happy with the upcoming quarter's guidance, which was lower than what analysts expected, causing the stock price to drop. Micron informed investors that a significant hit to the guidance was its PC customers' slowing demand for memory. Still, it is essential to note that the slowdown was caused not by consumer demand but by other chip shortages, which are stalling the production of computers.

Can Stanford University help solve the global semiconductor crisis?
With the U.S. poised to invest $50 billion in chip technologies, researchers prepare to create an infrastructure to accelerate how lab discoveries become practical technologies.

This next phase of semiconductor discovery will transcend electrical engineering and involve many other academic disciplines. | Stocksy/PER Images
Found in virtually every gadget powered by batteries or electricity, so ubiquitous as to be taken for granted, is that bedrock of our technological era, the semiconductor chip.
But last year, when automotive assembly lines stalled for lack of chips to build everything from anti-lock brakes to automatic door locks, public officials began to recognize the crisis that research and industrial scientists had seen coming.
“The world isn’t just facing production shortages for the chips we rely on today,” said Stanford electrical engineering Professor H.-S. Philip Wong. “We aren’t moving fast enough to create the next generation of semiconductors that we’ll need to broaden educational and economic opportunities, conserve energy and natural resources, and provide better and fairer access to technology.”
That sense of urgency and excitement suffused a recent virtual conference hosted by Stanford’s SystemX Alliance, which has, in various incarnations over the last 40 years, brought academic and industrial researchers together to develop new chip technologies and systems built on them. Prominent leaders of companies and academia presented visions for future generations of semiconductor technologies that will meet the insatiable demands for broadly accessible, energy-efficient computing. In many ways, Wong said, what we are seeing is less a crisis, but rather a huge opportunity.
H.-S. Philip Wong, the Willard R. and Inez Kerr Bell Professors in the School of Engineering
The June event – Future Directions of Semiconductor Technology – was held as the Senate passed, and the House of Representatives is poised to take up, a bill that President Joe Biden is eager to sign that will invest roughly $50 billion in new fabs, or semiconductor fabrication plants, as well as fund research into developing new chip technologies and applications.
The bipartisan consensus to boost the chip sector, which first emerged during the previous administration, gathered force as the auto plant shutdowns caught lawmakers’ attention and the Biden administration began to define infrastructure as silicon and circuitry as well as concrete and steel.
Wong said Stanford could help lead on an initiative that will emerge from this chip stimulus act – creating a national “lab to fab” infrastructure to reduce the friction that hampers translation of academic discoveries into practical technologies. Until now, the U.S. has relied on startups to commercialize discoveries, but as electronic systems become ever more complex, the costs and time of this scale-up process are impeding innovation.
“Fragments of lab-to-fab translation processes exist in other places around the world, but they are conspicuously absent in the United States,” Wong said.
Jennifer Dionne, Stanford’s senior associate vice provost for research platforms and shared facilities, said an interdisciplinary research culture is critical to creating lab-to-fab pathways, and in that arena, Stanford excels. She is helping Stanford bring together not just the facilities but researchers from across the university to foster the collaborations that lead to fresh ideas. “Solving society’s challenges requires outstanding facilities that bridge departmental and school boundaries and enable the university to fulfill its missions of research, education and the translation of discoveries into beneficial products and technologies,” said Dionne, who is also an associate professor of materials science and engineering.

Training the PhD students whose ideas will help propel semiconductor technologies forward is another important area where Stanford can contribute, says Debbie Senesky, associate professor of aeronautics and astronautics and, by courtesy, of electrical engineering. Senesky recently stepped in to lead nano@stanford, which is part of a network of facilities funded by the National Science Foundation to expose students to the tools of discovery. In that role, Senesky sets the research agenda for this next generation of chip experts.
“Our facilities serve as a spectacular sandbox for education and outreach on advanced concepts in nanotechnology,” Senesky said. “Students actively learn via hands-on training on the most advanced scientific tools. Students can deposit, etch and see atoms using our nanofabrication and nanocharacterization tools, setting them up for careers in Silicon Valley and beyond. Also, students at the K-12 level get exposed to nanotechnology from the activities in our facilities.”

Wong wants researchers across campus to realize that this next phase of semiconductor discovery will transcend electrical engineering and involve every discipline that can imagine new ways to build on foundational semiconductor technology to further its own research.
For example, Stanford SystemX Alliance recently teamed up with the Precourt Institute for Energy on a Pioneering Project Grant to seed ideas on energy-efficient computing, aiming to solve the demand side of the worldwide energy challenge. Wong said other Stanford educators are looking for ways to raise the profile of semiconductor research among aspiring STEM students.
Electrical engineering Professor Boris Murmann is working with the professional society, IEEE, to democratize chip design such that one day even a high school student will be able to design a chip and build a system she can sell on the internet. Professor Priyanka Raina was already pilot testing just such a democratization initiative for graduate students and senior undergraduates in her EE272B class at Stanford. For the students in the class, it was their first experience designing a chip. Raina, assistant professor of electrical engineering and, by courtesy, of computer science, now hopes to help with translating these design skills for college-bound high school learners.
“Stanford is being presented with an opportunity to make a big impact on society at a global scale and in a field that the world already associates with us,” Wong said. “And it isn’t just chips as they used to be. I spent the last few weeks learning from people here who are working on a technology called biofilms to process data using bacteria. Others are experimenting with DNA systems that can store a trillion gigabytes of data. The funding agencies are wide open to new ideas.”

Third quarter of 2021 looks bullish for majority semiconductor providers: IC Insights
By Gagan Kaur, Total Telecom
Monday 13 September 21
The semiconductor industry is likely to record massive growth in the third quarter due to crippling semiconductor shortage across the world.

In its recent compilation of the sales growth expectations for the top 25 semiconductor providers, IC Insights has revealed that the third quarter of 2021 will bode well for most players. Together, the top 15 semiconductor companies are forecast to record 7% growth in Q3 2021, according to IC Insights.

With the holiday season in the last quarter, semiconductor sales are expected to see strong growth through the end of the year. This is in line with IC Insights’ current forecast of worldwide semiconductor sales going up by 24% this year.

TSMC, the global market leader in the chip industry, expects its sales in Q3 to climb 11%. Furthermore, IC Insights believes it will see another 4% rise in Q4. These numbers indicate that the company will witness year on year growth of 24% in 2021. This would be the second consecutive year TSMC will see phenomenal growth after its staggering 31% increase in sales in 2020.

Coming to AMD, the 11th largest semiconductor company, in Q2 2021, the company anticipates its sales will rise 6% in Q3. This means that AMD expects to register an enormous 60% surge in sales for the year.

On the other hand, Sony is estimated to see a 34% increase in sales growth on one end, while Intel is expected to see a 3% decline on the other end.

As per IC Insights, in Q3 2021, Sony is estimated to see a 34% increase in sales growth on one end, while Intel will witness a 3% decline on the other end.

The IC Insights forecasts a 13% increase in the sale of Apple's custom processors and devices for internal use. On the other hand, Qualcomm is expected to post a growth of 12%, and Kioxia will see 11% growth, owing to the strong demand for memory in the datacentre servers, enterprise computing, 5G smartphones and other related infrastructure. The three major memory IC suppliers, Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron, are expected to record 10% growth.

The third quarter does not paint a rosy picture for all providers. Texas Instruments, for example, is guiding for flat sales results. Intel, the second-largest semiconductor supplier globally, is expected to see a decline of 3% in Q3. This will put its 2021 sales at a negative 1%, which is in contrast to the overall robust performance by the semiconductor industry.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: MaxLinear, Inc MXL, Semtech Corporation SMTC, Analog Devices, Inc. ADI and NXP Semiconductors N.V. NXPI.
Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:
3 Important Points from IDC Semiconductor Forecast and 4 Picks
There were three encouraging points in IDC's latest global semiconductor sales forecast for 2021.
First, the research firm now expects global semiconductor sales to grow 17.3% in 2021, on top of the 10.8% growth in 2020. The end markets driving this strength are mobile phones, notebooks, servers, automotive, smart home, gaming, wearables and Wi-Fi access points.
5G is clearly the main driver of semi revenues into the mobile phone market. So that segment is expected to grow 128%, with total mobile semiconductor revenues up 28.5%. And that's still stronger than X86 server chips, which will see revenue growth of 24.6%. Sales into the notebook market will be up 11.8% while game consoles, smart home, and wearable semis will grow a respective 34%, 20% and 21%. And automotive semiconductor revenues will increase 22.8%.
Which brings us to the second important takeaway. IDC expects the shortages in the auto market to be mitigated by year-end. We all know how crazy that has been. That has been a major factor holding back the sector, caught in between soaring demand and depleted inventory.
Overall, the firm sees front-end manufacturing beginning to meet consumption (which is healthy despite the COVID scare) in the third quarter as foundries step in to fill gaps, but cautions that back-end constraints and material shortages remain. The market is currently not expected to normalize until the middle of 2022 with the possibility of overcapacity by year-end as new fabs come online. Still, the semiconductor market will grow at a CAGR of 5.3% through 2025, which is a good bit stronger than the typical 3-4% growth historically.

Since the end of the Great Recession in 2009, growth stocks have rightly been the talk of Wall Street. A 2013 report from J.P. Morgan Asset Management showed that companies initiating and growing their payouts between 1972 and 2012 averaged an annual return of 9.5%. While it's clear that profitable, time-tested companies paying a dividend have delivered superior long-term returns, the question remains: Which dividend stocks to buy?

Insider Buying Could Indicate a Bottom in These 2 Stocks
Buying low and selling high may sound too basic to support a stock portfolio, but it has been and always will be a sure way to build profits.

Why Is Nio Stock Dropping Despite Record Deliveries?
Shares of electric vehicle maker Nio (NYSE: NIO) rose 3% Friday morning before losing ground as the day progressed, trading down just about 0.5% as of 1:40 p.m. today. The weakness in the EV stock's price is surprising given that Nio reached a milestone and reported solid delivery numbers for September today, even topping its own projections. Nio delivered a record number of 10,628 vehicles in total in September, up 125.7% year over year.

The computer chip industry has a dirty climate secret

T
he semiconductor industry has a problem. Demand is booming for silicon chips, which are embedded in everything from smartphones and televisions to wind turbines, but it comes at a big cost: a huge carbon footprint.
The industry presents a paradox. Meeting global climate goals will, in part, rely on semiconductors. They’re integral to electric vehicles, solar arrays and wind turbines. But chip manufacturing also contributes to the climate crisis. It requires huge amounts of energy and water – a chip fabrication plant, or fab, can use millions of gallons of water a day – and creates hazardous waste.
As the semiconductor industry finds itself increasingly under the spotlight, it is starting to grapple with its climate impacts. Last week Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world’s largest chipmaker, which supplies chips to Apple, pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2050. The company aims to “broaden our green influence and drive the industry towards low-carbon sustainability”, said the TSMC chairman, Mark Lui.
But decarbonizing the industry will be a big challenge.
TSMC alone uses almost 5% of all Taiwan’s electricity, according to figures from Greenpeace, predicted to rise to 7.2% in 2022, and it used about 63m tons of water in 2019. The company’s water use became a controversial topic during Taiwan’s drought this year, the country’s worst in a half century, which pitted chipmakers against farmers.
In the US, a single fab, Intel’s 700-acre campus in Ocotillo, Arizona, produced nearly 15,000 tons of waste in the first three months of this year, about 60% of it hazardous. It also consumed 927m gallons of fresh water, enough to fill about 1,400 Olympic swimming pools, and used 561m kilowatt-hours of energy.
Chip manufacturing, rather than energy consumption or hardware use, “accounts for most of the carbon output” from electronics devices, the Harvard researcher Udit Gupta and co-authors wrote in a 2020 paper.

A global shortage of high-end chips, as the pandemic boosted demand for electronics and Covid outbreaks closed fabs, has increased focus on the industry.
In a tight market, automakers found themselves at the back of the chip queue, far behind much bigger-scale semiconductor customers such as Apple, who use the chips to give computing power to their smartphones, laptops and other devices. GM halted production in several of its North American factories this month, while Toyota said it would cut its carmaking by 40% in September.
In an attempt to increase production, many countries are embarking on big programs to boost the industry.
The Chips for America Act proposes $52bn in funding over five years for the US semiconductor industry. The EU has forwarded its own legislation aimed at increasing its share of the global chips market to 20% by 2030. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, called it “a matter of tech sovereignty” in her State of the European Union address last week.
These ambitions line up a potential clash with international climate goals. Both the EU and US aim to get halfway to net zero carbon emissions by 2030, and to net zero by 2050. And as the semiconductor industry grows, so too will its carbon footprint.

However, amid pressure from investors and electronics makers keen to report greener supply chains to customers, the semiconductor business has been ramping up action on tackling its climate footprint.
“Recently, I started seeing our effects on the environment completely come to the forefront,” said Sohini Dasgupta, principal design engineer at ON Semiconductors.
Two years ago, she said, the industry “was sitting on the fence, in the middle of the pack, saying: ‘Yes, sustainability is important, but we don’t know what to do with it’”. But now she sees movement: “Every day it pops up in our emails, what our company’s doing, what other companies are doing,” she said.
The rise of ethical investing has helped, according to Mark Li, a semiconductor analyst at the investment firm Bernstein. Fund managers increasingly market “green funds” and investors are asking more questions about companies’ environmental, social, and governance (ESG) impact. “Over the last three years, the voice of ESG investment is much louder than before,” Li said. Ultimately, this changes how companies behave, he added.
Greater availability of renewable energy is helping chipmakers reduce their carbon footprint. Intel made a commitment to source 100% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030, as did TSMC, but with a deadline of 2050.
Energy consumption accounts for 62% of TSMC’s emissions, said a company spokesperson, Nina Kao. The company signed a 20-year deal last year with the Danish energy firm Ørsted, buying all the energy from a 920-megawatt offshore windfarm Ørsted is building in the Taiwan Strait.
The deal, which has been described as the world’s largest corporate renewables purchase agreement, has benefits for TSMC, said Shashi Barla, renewables analyst at the energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. As well as guaranteeing a clean electricity supply, it pays a wholesale cost and removes itself from price shocks, “killing two birds with one stone”, he said.
TSMC’s actions have the potential to influence the rest of the industry, said Clifton Fonstad, professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT, “other manufacturers are likely to follow its lead”.
As well as switching to renewables, chipmakers could also implement efficiencies in fabs, said Peter Hanbury, a semiconductor manufacturing expert at the management consultancy Bain & Company. A chip fab is basically “a gigantic warehouse with a clean room inside”, he said, and to cut emissions, “the easy part is the facility itself”.
Fabs could be more efficient in regulating air and water temperature, humidity, and pressure. They could segment warehouses so one production line had high pressure, and another lower, using less energy than keeping the entire warehouse at a high pressure.
They could capture more data and use machine learning to turn tools off when they weren’t being used, said Huili Grace Xing, an engineering professor at Cornell University who works on semiconductor materials.
There is also innovation aimed at tackling the worst-polluting materials used in making semiconductors. The chip industry uses different gases during the production process, many of which have a significant climate impact.
Chip companies make lots of money. So even though all these green carbon measures would have a cost, they can afford it
Mark Li, semiconductor analyst
TSMC said it had implemented scrubbers and other facilities to treat gas emissions. But another route is replacing “dirtier” cleaning gases that clean the delicate tools in semiconductor manufacturing, said Michael Pittroff, a chemical engineer working on semiconductor gases at Solvay Special Chemicals.
In industrial tests over the last six years with about a half dozen chipmaker clients, Pittroff said, he and his team had replaced more polluting gases with “cleaner” fluorine, with a lower global warming impact.
Other companies target the gases that are used to etch patterns onto and clean the silicon surface of a wafer – the thin piece of material used to make semiconductors. Paris-based industrial gases company Air Liquide, for example, has come up with a line of alternative etching gases with lower global warming impacts.
But replacing gases will be a challenge: anything that touches the silicon wafer, such as an etching gas, is really hard to alter once a fab is operating, said Hanbury. The process involves a huge amount of precision. Fabs have to place up to 100m transistors on a postage-stamp sized wafer and need to do it perfectly. It takes four to five years for fabs to develop a recipe for this and “once you set it, you basically never want to change it”, Hanbury said.
Some experts believe chipmakers will start to modify their processes to incorporate greener gases, especially if the big players make a move. “If TSMC switches, I am sure the others will,” said Fonstad. “If TSMC doesn’t, then other manufacturers may switch to show they are better than TSMC.”
To some observers of the chip business, the determination to clean up the industry seems real. The vast demand for chips at the moment will only help the semiconductor industry embrace sustainability goals, said Li.
“They have very good margins, and make lots of money. So even though all these green carbon measures would have a cost, they can afford it. And increasingly, customers are willing to pay more for a greener device,” he said.

Ford CEO: Semiconductor shortage is improving but will extend into next year

Ford (F) is starting to see some relief in the semiconductor shortage that has severely hurt vehicle production at automakers globally this year. 
CEO Jim Farley told Yahoo Finance Live the flow of semiconductors has begun to improve. Conditions in the third quarter have been better compared to the fourth quarter, Farley explained. Even still, Farley acknowledged the chip supply shortage will be an issue for the auto industry into 2022. 
At the moment, investors appear to be looking beyond the chip shortage. 
Shares of Ford popped 4% in pre-market trading Tuesday after the Detroit-based auto giant said late Monday it will partner with SK Innovation to invest $11.4 billion to construct two ""mega-sites"" — one in Tennessee and the other in Kentucky — that will build electric trucks and batteries. Ford's portion of the investment — $7 billion — is the largest manufacturing investment in the company's 118-year-old history.
Stanton, Tennessee will see the construction of Blue Oval City, which Ford says will aid in building an ""expanded"" electric-truck lineup. Currently, Ford has released the all-electric SUV called the Mach-E and soon will begin producing the all-electric F-150 Lightning. The 3,600-acre campus will cover nearly 6 square miles, at a total of $5.6 billion. It's expected to create 6,000 jobs.

No less impressive is the other mega-campus slated to open in Glendale, Kentucky. Dubbed BlueOvalSK Battery Park, it will be a dedicated battery manufacturing complex for Ford's expanding roster of electric vehicles. The 1,500-acre site will cost $5.8 billion to build and create 5,000 jobs. The location is targeted to open in 2025.
Farley told Yahoo Finance Live the investment is akin to planting a major flag in the ground in its efforts to lead the EV market.

According to researchers from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), a recently discovered family of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors could pave the way for high-performance and energy-efficient electronics. Their findings, published in npj 2D Materials and Applications, may lead to the fabrication of semiconductor devices applicable in mainstream electronics and optoelectronics—and even potentially replace silicon-based device technology altogether.
In the quest of miniaturizing electronic devices, one well-known trend is Moore’s law, which describes how the number of components in the integrated circuits of computers doubles every two years. This trend is possible thanks to the ever-decreasing size of transistors, some of which are so small that millions of them can be crammed onto a chip the size of a fingernail. But as this trend continues, engineers are starting to grapple with the inherent material limitations of silicon-based device technology.

On the other hand, an energy-efficient Ohmic contact can be achieved by using titanium electrode.

“Due to the quantum tunneling effect, shrinking a silicon-based transistor too small will lead to highly uncontrollable device behaviors,” said SUTD Assistant Professor Ang Yee Sin, who led the study. “People are now looking for new materials beyond the ‘silicon era’, and 2D semiconductors are a promising candidate.”
2D semiconductors are materials that are only a few atoms thick. Because of their nanoscale size, such materials are strong contenders as replacements for silicon in the quest of developing compact electronic devices. However, many currently available 2D semiconductors are plagued by high electrical resistance when they come into contact with metals.
“When you form a contact between metal and semiconductor, often there will be what we call a Schottky barrier,” explained Ang. “In order to force electricity through this barrier, you need to apply a strong voltage, which wastes electricity and generates waste heat.”
This piqued the team’s interest in Ohmic contacts, or metal-semiconductor contacts with no Schottky barrier. In their study, Ang and collaborators from Nanjing University, the National University of Singapore, and Zhejiang University showed that a recently discovered family of 2D semiconductors, namely MoSi2N4 and WSi2N4, form Ohmic contacts with the metals titanium, scandium, and nickel, which are widely used in the semiconductor device industry.
Furthermore, the researchers also showed that the new materials are free from Fermi level pinning (FLP), a problem that severely limits the application potential of other 2D semiconductors.
“FLP is an adverse effect that happens in many metal-semiconductor contacts, and is caused by defects and complex materials interactions at the contact interface,” Ang said.  “Such an effect ‘pins’ the electrical properties of the contact to a narrow range regardless of the metal used in the contact.”
Because of FLP, engineers are unable to tune or adjust the Schottky barrier between the metal and semiconductor—diminishing the design flexibility of a semiconductor device.
To minimize FLP, engineers usually employ strategies like very gently and slowly positioning the metal on top of the 2D semiconductor, creating a buffer layer between the metal and semiconductor or using a 2D metal as a contact material with the 2D semiconductor. While these methods are feasible, they are not yet practical and are incompatible with mass fabrication using mainstream industry techniques available today.
Amazingly, Ang’s team showed that MoSi2N4 and WSi2N4 are naturally protected from FLP due to an inert Si-N outer layer that shields the underlying semiconducting layer from defects and material interactions at the contact interface.
Because of this protection, the Schottky barrier is ‘unpinned’ and can be tuned to match a wide array of application requirements. This improvement in performance helps put 2D semiconductors in the running as replacements for silicon-based technology, with major players like TSMC and Samsung already expressing interest in 2D semiconductor electronics.
Ang hopes that their work will encourage other researchers to probe more members of the newly discovered 2D semiconductor family for interesting properties, even those with applications beyond electronics.
“Some of them might be very poor in terms of electronics applications but very good for spintronics, photocatalysts, or as a building block for solar cells,” he concluded. “Our next challenge is to systematically scan through all of these 2D materials and categorize them according to their potential applications.”
