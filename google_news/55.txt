Following Micron Technology Inc's (NASDAQ: MU) mixed financial results, Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers maintained his long-term bullish outlook on the stock. He also sees upside in NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ: AMD).
What Happened: Micron reported adjusted quarterly earnings of $2.42 per share, which beat the estimate of $2.33 per share. The company reported quarterly revenue of $8.27 billion, which beat the estimate of $8.22 billion.
Micron expects fiscal first-quarter earnings to be in a range of $2 per share to $2.20 per share versus the estimate of $2.61 per share. The company expects fiscal first-quarter revenue to be in a range of $7.45 billion to $7.85 billion versus the estimate of $8.63 billion.
Wells Fargo's Assessment: Rakers told CNBC Micron's financial results were "relatively in line" with his expectations.
The company may face some near-term inventory issues, but the Wells Fargo analyst thinks "the longer-term positive thesis is still very much intact for Micron."
"Regardless of the near-term choppiness, we very much do like Micron," Rakers said.
