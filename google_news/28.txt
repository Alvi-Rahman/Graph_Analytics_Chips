Video Transcript
BRIAN SOZZI: All right, welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live. Let's hit some tickers lighting up the Yahoo Finance platform right now. Guys, let's start with Micron here. Always a forward looking company. Always watched closely by the market reports early in the earnings season shares. Are under pressure here after the companies. I would say, disappointing earnings call last night. Micron is the number two, number two trending ticker behind Lucid on the Yahoo Finance platform.
Now, really a couple of concerns here. One, the Deutsche Bank team mentioning that Micron missed some of the whisper numbers out there on the street with respect to their current quarter sales and earnings guidance. Of course, that's not good. But it was really the commentary on the earnings call here that I think spooked a lot of investors, coming from CEO Sanjay Mehrotra, noting quote, "Some PC customers are adjusting their memory and storage purchases due to shortages of non-memory components that are needed to complete PC bills or demand. We expect this adjustment for our PC customers to be largely resolved in the coming months.
Wrap that all up there Julie, and I think Micron is warning about somewhat of a slowdown or more challenging quarters ahead in the PC market and I think that's why you're seeing shares of HP under pressure. Worth noting, though, that stock was also downgraded by JP Morgan this morning.
- Yeah. Specifically, the forecast from Micron was also weaker than estimated. The company said sales are going to be about $7.65 billion in the current quarter. About 8 and 1/2 billion is what analysts have been looking for in the earnings per share forecast also below estimates. It's interesting because Mehrotra has tried to emphasize that Micron's business has gotten more steady. It's not going to be as volatile, and yet here we do indeed see that volatility.

4 Stocks Expected to Increase Sales 25,750% to 2,970,000% in 5 Years
High-growth stocks have dominated Wall Street for more than a decade -- and with good reason. According to Wall Street's consensus estimates, these four stocks are forecast to increase sales by 25,750% to as much as 2,970,000% (that's nearly 3 million percent) over the next five years. A clinical-stage biotech stock angling for its first approved therapy is a perfect example of a business that could grow from a relatively small amount of non-recurring revenue to a considerably larger sum of recurring sales.
