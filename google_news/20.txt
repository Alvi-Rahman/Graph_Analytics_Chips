The semiconductor industry is having a mixed year. In continuation of last year's astonishing performance by the broader technology sector, the semiconductor industry was doing well. However, market participants' concerns about overvaluation of the technology sector and impending inflation led to price correction and semiconductors are no exception.
Nevertheless, a few semiconductor stocks with a top Zacks Rank are currently available at attractive valuations with immense upside left for the rest of 2021. Investment in these stocks may be fruitful going forward.
A Mixed 2021 So Far for Semiconductor Industry
The semiconductor industry started 2021 impressively as it is at the forefront of the ongoing technological revolution based on HPC, AI, automated driving, IoT and so on. These companies also enable the cloud to function and help analyze data into actionable insights that can be used by businesses to operate more efficiently.
The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) is up 5.7% year to date. However, the index jumped 18.5% to reach its 52-week high of 3,314.16 on Apr 5.Thereafter, the SOX slid 10.8% till May 17. on concerns about higher valuation, inflationary expectations and the possibility of the Fed raising the benchmark interest rate earlier than expected.
Expectation of Budgetary Support
On May 14, Reuters reported that this week the U.S. Senate will debate on a bill to spend more than $110 billion on basic U.S. and advanced technology research to combat the growing competitive threat from China.
The bill will include $39 billion in production and R&D incentives for semiconductor chips and $10.5 billion to implement programs including the National Semiconductor Technology Center, National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program, and other R&D programs.
Moreover, Reuters reported that a group of Senators are expected to introduce a package of $52 billion to boost semiconductor chip production and R&D activities over a period of five years. Notably, President Joe Biden also expressed his intention to provide a $50 billion budgetary support to accelerate semiconductor production and research.

Why Macy's, Nordstrom, and Party City Just Crashed
Tic-tac-toe, three in a row, shares of retail stocks Macy's (NYSE: M), Nordstrom (NYSE: JWN), and Party City Holdco (NYSE: PRTY) crashed in quick succession Thursday, and were trading down by 7.9%, 9.1%, and 12.4%, respectively, as of 1:54 p.m. EDT. You can probably blame another retail stock -- Kohl's (NYSE: KSS) -- for all of that. You see, there was no particularly bad news on the wires concerning Macy's, Nordstrom, or Party City Thursday.

Congress is about to kill this popular retirement tax move
If you were planning to do a “Roth IRA” conversion to keep your retirement savings permanently out of the hands of the IRS, you might want to get on it. The new tax bill on Capitol Hill is going to scrap these conversions for everybody after the end of the year—and, no, not just for those earning more than $400,000 a year. The bill “prohibits all employee after-tax contributions in qualified plans and prohibits after-tax IRA contributions from being converted to Roth regardless of income level, effective for distributions, transfers, and contributions made after Dec. 31, 2021,” reports the House Ways & Means Committee.

4 Stocks Expected to Increase Sales 25,750% to 2,970,000% in 5 Years
High-growth stocks have dominated Wall Street for more than a decade -- and with good reason. According to Wall Street's consensus estimates, these four stocks are forecast to increase sales by 25,750% to as much as 2,970,000% (that's nearly 3 million percent) over the next five years. A clinical-stage biotech stock angling for its first approved therapy is a perfect example of a business that could grow from a relatively small amount of non-recurring revenue to a considerably larger sum of recurring sales.

Rising Treasury bond yields around the world fueled a sell-off on Wall Street this week, as investors start to worry that stocks may be priced too high. The shift in the market comes as the Federal Reserve gives hints that it may switch from its current ultra-low rate policy to gradual rate increases as early as next year. Such a move will boost bond yields, a development that typically comes at the expense of stocks. In addition to worries about the Fed’s rate policy, markets are also dealing w

On that note, here are two great healthcare stocks to consider buying right now that you can hold and keep adding to for many years regardless of what the market does.

3 Top Energy Dividend Stocks to Buy in October
Sure, solely buying income-generating stocks means you would have missed out on some of the stock market's most successful companies, such as Amazon.com and Netflix, which don't pay dividends but since 2002 have risen 17,500% and 49,400%, respectively, compared to the S&P 500's 309% gain. Like many large oil companies, Chevron (NYSE: CVX) suffered big losses during the early months of the pandemic. As economic activity around the world all but came to a standstill and demand for oil plunged, this energy giant engineered dramatic cost-cutting initiatives while also making opportunistic acquisitions of Noble Energy and Noble Midstream Partners.
