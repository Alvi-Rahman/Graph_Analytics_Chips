In this article, we discuss the 12 best semiconductor stocks to invest in right now. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to the 5 Best Semiconductor Stocks To Invest In Right Now.
Behind every great technology and innovation of today is a powerful microchip. Despite the disruption in the global supply chain, the semiconductor industry continued to thrive in 2020, owing to the increased demand for PCs, 5G smartphones, and infrastructure products for hyperscale data centers. According to Gartner's data, the global semiconductor revenue increased by 7.3% in 2020 to $449.8 billion, following a 12% decline in 2019. In comparison, global semiconductor sales rose 21.7% to $41.8 billion in April 2021, indicating a steady demand.
The supply of semiconductors for healthcare and technology remained consistent, while the automobile industry encountered a chip supply crisis in the first quarter of 2021. In response to the shortages, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE: TSM) has boosted its capital spending budget for 2021 to $30 billion. Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE: TSM) have gained 7% in the last three months. 
Meanwhile, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC), the world's largest semiconductor company by revenue, announced in March 2021 that it would invest $20 billion in two new chip manufacturing facilities in Arizona. Patrick Gelsinger, CEO of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC), stated that a new division called Intel Foundry Services will begin producing semiconductors for other chipmakers. Shares of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) jumped 8%, year to date.
Although supply and demand concerns have resurfaced as a result of the surge in Delta variant, Jefferies top-ranked semiconductor analyst Mark Lipacis is still very bullish on industry leaders Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADI), Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRVL), Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ: MCHP), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA).

Congress is about to kill this popular retirement tax move
If you were planning to do a “Roth IRA” conversion to keep your retirement savings permanently out of the hands of the IRS, you might want to get on it. The new tax bill on Capitol Hill is going to scrap these conversions for everybody after the end of the year—and, no, not just for those earning more than $400,000 a year. The bill “prohibits all employee after-tax contributions in qualified plans and prohibits after-tax IRA contributions from being converted to Roth regardless of income level, effective for distributions, transfers, and contributions made after Dec. 31, 2021,” reports the House Ways & Means Committee.

Why Nvidia Stock Just Popped
Shares of semiconductor specialist Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) -- already one of the biggest names in video games -- got a bit bigger this morning when the company announced it has landed a new partner for its Nvidia GeForce NOW online gaming service. In today's press release, Nvidia says Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: EA) will make its "hit games" and Apex Legends available on Nvidia's cloud gaming service. This is good news for Nvidia, which last year lost multiple high-profile partners after it declined to strike revenue-sharing deals with them -- and as some of its partners struck out on their own to develop independent online gaming systems.

4 Stocks Expected to Increase Sales 25,750% to 2,970,000% in 5 Years
High-growth stocks have dominated Wall Street for more than a decade -- and with good reason. According to Wall Street's consensus estimates, these four stocks are forecast to increase sales by 25,750% to as much as 2,970,000% (that's nearly 3 million percent) over the next five years. A clinical-stage biotech stock angling for its first approved therapy is a perfect example of a business that could grow from a relatively small amount of non-recurring revenue to a considerably larger sum of recurring sales.
