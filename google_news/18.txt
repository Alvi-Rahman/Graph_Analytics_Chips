Growth in demand for cloud services fueled by coronavirus-induced work-and-learn-from-home necessity and increased usage of online services globally have compelled data center operators to bolster their cloud-storage capacities. This has further boosted demand for data-center chips from data center operators.

Per Technavio report, the data center market is expected to grow to $519.34 billion during 2021-2025, at a CAGR of 21%, driven by the growing clout of cloud services and digitization. Further, increase in adoption of multi-cloud and network upgrade to support 5G is fueling growth.

In fact, semiconductor companies, including Advanced Micro Devices AMD and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited TSM delivered impressive performance in the first quarter driven by strength in data center vertical.
Growth Prospects Aplenty
Evolution of semiconductor manufacturing processes from 10 nanometer (nm) to 7 nm to 5 nm and even 3 nm technology is opening new business avenues. The accelerated deployment of 5G technology is anticipated to spur further growth.

Additionally, momentum in high performance computing (HPC) applications, gaming, wearables, drones and VR/AR devices due to the coronavirus crisis, which has led to increase in usage of online services globally, is fueling massive growth in the semiconductor space. It is projected to hit $522 billion in 2021, indicating growth of 12.5% on a year-over-year basis, per IDC data.

Moreover, improvements in DRAM and NAND pricing are acting as tailwinds for semiconductor stocks catering to the memory market.

Further, spike in worldwide sales of semiconductors buoys optimism. Notably, per data from The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), global semiconductor industry sales were $123.1 billion in first-quarter 2021, up 17.8% on a year-over-year basis.

The optimism surrounding semiconductor stocks can also be ascertained by the robust performance of iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) on a year-to-date basis, which has rallied 15.3% compared with the SPDR S&P 500 ETF’s (SPY) rise of 13%. Further, SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (XSD), which tracks the S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index, has gained 5.2% year to date.

Considering growth prospects of the chip makers driven by data center boom and HPC push, it makes sense to invest for long-term gains. Here we present five stocks to invest in at the moment, considering growth prospects of the chip makers driven by data center boom and HPC push.

Tic-tac-toe, three in a row, shares of retail stocks Macy's (NYSE: M), Nordstrom (NYSE: JWN), and Party City Holdco (NYSE: PRTY) crashed in quick succession Thursday, and were trading down by 7.9%, 9.1%, and 12.4%, respectively, as of 1:54 p.m. EDT.

Congress is about to kill this popular retirement tax move
If you were planning to do a “Roth IRA” conversion to keep your retirement savings permanently out of the hands of the IRS, you might want to get on it. The new tax bill on Capitol Hill is going to scrap these conversions for everybody after the end of the year—and, no, not just for those earning more than $400,000 a year. The bill “prohibits all employee after-tax contributions in qualified plans and prohibits after-tax IRA contributions from being converted to Roth regardless of income level, effective for distributions, transfers, and contributions made after Dec. 31, 2021,” reports the House Ways & Means Committee.

4 Stocks Expected to Increase Sales 25,750% to 2,970,000% in 5 Years
High-growth stocks have dominated Wall Street for more than a decade -- and with good reason. According to Wall Street's consensus estimates, these four stocks are forecast to increase sales by 25,750% to as much as 2,970,000% (that's nearly 3 million percent) over the next five years. A clinical-stage biotech stock angling for its first approved therapy is a perfect example of a business that could grow from a relatively small amount of non-recurring revenue to a considerably larger sum of recurring sales.

3 Top Energy Dividend Stocks to Buy in October

Like many large oil companies, Chevron (NYSE: CVX) suffered big losses during the early months of the pandemic. As economic activity around the world all but came to a standstill and demand for oil plunged, this energy giant engineered dramatic cost-cutting initiatives while also making opportunistic acquisitions of Noble Energy and Noble Midstream Partners.
