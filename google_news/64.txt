Shares of semiconductor, chip and memory companies, including ON Semiconductor Corp (NASDAQ: ON) are trading lower in sympathy with Micron, which issued first-quarter EPS and sales guidance below estimates.
Shares of technology companies at large are also trading lower this week amid a rise in bond yields, which has weighed on growth stock valuations.
ON Semiconductor is a leading supplier of power and analog semiconductors, as well as sensors. ON is the second-largest global supplier of discrete transistors like insulated gate bipolar transistors, or IGBTs, and metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors, or MOSFETs, and also has a significant integrated power chip business.
ON Semiconductor is trading lower by 4.5% at $45.22. ON Semiconductor has a 52-week high of $49.78 and a 52-week low of $21.55.

Analyst Report: ASML Holding N.V.
Founded in 1984 and based in the Netherlands, ASML is a leading manufacturer of photolithography systems used in the manufacturing of semiconductors. Photolithography is the process in which a light source is used to expose circuit patterns from a photomask onto a semiconductor wafer. The latest technological advances in this segment allow chipmakers to continually increase the number of transistors on the same area of silicon, with lithography historically representing a meaningful portion of the cost of making cutting-edge chips. Chipmakers require next-generation EUV lithography tools from ASML to continue past the 7-nanometer process node. ASML's products are used at every major semiconductor manufacturer, including Intel, Samsung, and TSMC.

4 Stocks Expected to Increase Sales 25,750% to 2,970,000% in 5 Years
High-growth stocks have dominated Wall Street for more than a decade -- and with good reason. According to Wall Street's consensus estimates, these four stocks are forecast to increase sales by 25,750% to as much as 2,970,000% (that's nearly 3 million percent) over the next five years. A clinical-stage biotech stock angling for its first approved therapy is a perfect example of a business that could grow from a relatively small amount of non-recurring revenue to a considerably larger sum of recurring sales.
